Start from a blank canvas to a completely responsive, CMS-driven portfolio that will generate leads ‚Äî and potentially tear a hole in the very fabric of space and time.</p></div><div class="transcript-overflow"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>In this course, we‚Äôre going to build a full UX designer‚Äôs portfolio ‚Äî but the principles of design and development we‚Äôre covering can apply to portfolios and projects of all types ‚Äî and we‚Äôll be using the same exact CSS properties used by Apple and Stripe and Awwwards ‚Äî almost every development leader throughout the industry.¬†<br/></p><p>Now whether you‚Äôre advanced or you‚Äôre just getting started in web design and development, we‚Äôre here to give you the guidance and the confidence...<br/></p><p>[Sara] I changed it again because Playfair is very 2016...</p><p>[McGuire] We‚Äôre filming.</p><p>[Sara] Yeah yeah yeah ‚Äî keep going. I have my coffee.</p><p>[McGuire] Is that a Pumpkin‚Ä¶?</p><p>[Sara] Pumpkin Spice Latte? No. That‚Äôs not even a Swedish thing.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Throughout this course, we‚Äôll be referencing Sara‚Äôs portfolio design in Figma, and we‚Äôll build it as a production-ready site (a CMS-driven portfolio)...right in Webflow.¬†<br/></p><p>Now. We designed this course to be taken over 21 days (one main lesson every day). And we did this not only to absorb the information at a pace we find works really well for designers, but to work on a lot of this yourself ‚Äî to build and iterate on your portfolio design throughout the course. At center of that, Grimur‚Äôs also going to be here with what he‚Äôs calling a 21-day challenge. Grimur?<br/></p><p>[Gr√≠mur] McGuire.<br/></p><p>[McGuire] Do you want to let us know about‚Ä¶<br/></p><p>[Gr√≠mur] Thanks, McGuire. The 21-day challenge is exactly that. As you go through the course and design or update your own portfolio, I‚Äôm going to use my significant influence to share some of our favorite work on Webflow‚Äôs social channels, so, just wait. I have some stuff planned.<br/></p><p>[McGuire] We‚Äôll come back to Grimur after each major lesson. Now Figma‚Äôs where Sara has started to design an example portfolio for a fictional UX Designer named Megan...who‚Äôs an amalgam.<br/></p><p>[McGuire] It‚Äôs...it‚Äôs a word.</p><p>[Sara] Just don‚Äôt say it again.</p><p>[Gr√≠mur] Yeah, I‚Äôm on Murrial Webster.</p><p>[McGuire] (that‚Äôs not it.)</p><p>[Gr√≠mur] Aaand ‚Äúe-melgum‚Äù is not a word.</p><p>[McGuire] Megan‚Äôs portfolio is based on several extremely effective design portfolios we&#x27;ve created and learned from through the years. And we‚Äôll cover every step of the process. This means we‚Äôll cover the homepage, project pages for each client or each rebuild that‚Äôs being featured, a contact page ‚Äî and we‚Äôll take it even further by building out 2D and 3D interactions, Google Analytics, open graph and SEO settings, and everything else needed to ensure we‚Äôve checked and reviewed our portfolio before we publish it to the web.<br/></p><p>The objective here is to create a clean, direct representation of Megan‚Äôs work ‚Äî so potential employers or clients can quickly make a decision about reaching out to Megan for UX design services. And we‚Äôre doing this over 21 parts ‚Äî 3 weeks if you‚Äôre doing this one lesson a day, or of course, you can take this at your own pace.<br/></p><p>But we‚Äôll break things down from the very beginning, so if this is your first design and development project in Webflow, we‚Äôll give you all the tools you need to be successful. If you‚Äôre already familiar with advanced web design and development, a lot of this stuff will feel right at home.<br/></p><p>Now. There‚Äôs something different about this course (something different from every other course in the world). If you look at this newspaper, you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs dated December 21st.<br/></p><p>[Sara] 2021]</p><p>[McGuire] That‚Äôs right, Sara. To those in this studio, this is today‚Äôs paper. But to anyone watching this before December 21st, 2021, this course...is from the future. The future. Is incredible.<br/></p><p>[Sara] So incredible.</p><p>[McGuire] Especially with the Apple (product launch)<br/></p><p>[Sara] Apple launch. So expensive. Space gray.<br/></p><p>[McGuire] Unbelievably shiny, and in Space gray.<br/></p><p>But here‚Äôs the thing. We took everything we learned from the future, brought it back to the start of the year, and presented it...in this course. Is that illegal?¬†<br/></p><p>[Sara] Yes.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Questionable.</p><p>[Sara] Mmmm...<br/></p><p>Remember: we almost always release lessons earlier on Webflow University, so check there for the most up-to-date parts of this course, if you‚Äôre not doing that.<br/></p><p>But whether you‚Äôre following along from the past, present, or future, we‚Äôre really excited to cover each and every aspect...of this design portfolio...for a completely fictional person.<br/></p></div></nav></div></div><a href="/lesson/portfolio-course-introduction" class="button cc-primary cc-margin-top w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a><div class="button-container"><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Download assets</div></a></div><div class="button-wrapper margin"><a href="https://webflow.com/website/Megan-Garcia-Portfolio-Blank-pages" target="_blank" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block"><div>Clone this project</div></a></div><a href="#" class="button cc-primary w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a></div></div><div class="w-embed"><div style="display: none;" data-lesson-video-url="https://youtu.be/eh4dWMtULrg"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-2 lesson-content w-dyn-item"><div class="flex_vertical_left"><h2 class="h3">Homepage</h2><div class="rich_light w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="transcript-overflow w-condition-invisible"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></nav></div></div><a href="/lesson/section-heading-homepage" class="button cc-primary cc-margin-top w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a><div class="button-container"><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Download assets</div></a></div><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Clone this project</div></a></div><a href="#" class="button cc-primary w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a></div></div><div class="w-embed"><div style="display: none;" data-lesson-video-url=""></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-2 lesson-content w-dyn-item"><div class="flex_vertical_left"><h2 class="h3">Homepage: hero section</h2><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>Create an eye-catching hero section to draw the attention of your site visitors.¬†<br/></p></div><div class="transcript-overflow"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>We‚Äôre going to build the homepage here, and we‚Äôll do it in several different parts. We‚Äôre doing this so there‚Äôs a clear objective, a clear deliverable for each lesson. And we‚Äôre setting this up using the same HTML and CSS properties we‚Äôd use if we were coding the UI and the UX work by hand. But by the end of this part, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll have: we‚Äôll have the structure for the hero section, we‚Äôll have the text elements, we‚Äôll have the Body tag that‚Äôs also defaults for our entire project, and we‚Äôll have the hero image area. Later, we‚Äôll build this into a fully interactive animation. And, along the way, we‚Äôll check in with Sara to make sure we‚Äôre closely adhering to her work in Figma.¬†</p><p>[Sara] I‚Äôm watching you.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] What‚Äôs up?¬†</p><p>[Sara] (laughs) That&#x27;s so bad, I can&#x27;t look at you. You&#x27;re like ‚Äî</p><p>[McGuire] What‚Äôs your confidence level?¬†</p><p>[Sara] There‚Äôs nothing to suggest I‚Äôm not confident and you‚Äôre going to follow that design.</p><p>You‚Äôre not convinced?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] No.</p><p>[Sara] Tell me why you feel otherwise.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Well, you have Grimur on speaker, you‚Äôre holding the red pen, there‚Äôs a note in the Figma project that says ‚Äòfollow this design,‚Äô and for the last eight minutes you‚Äôve been air playing your phone to the studio monitors, where you texted your mother in Sweden saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not confident he is going to follow the design.‚Äô</p><p>[Sara] Well, are you going to?</p><p>[McGuire] Follow the design?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Yes.¬†</p><p>And we‚Äôll start with the structure. In fact, before we add any elements to the page let‚Äôs go ahead and drag in our assets. Now, we‚Äôve included these down below, so feel free to download and follow along, but once we do that, we‚Äôre ready to move on to the structure of the page. And it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. We‚Äôll go to the add panel, and from here, we‚Äôre going to drag in two things for our primary structure. We‚Äôll drag in a section element, so this is a hundred percent width, and we‚Äôll drag in a container. A container of course, keeps everything neatly bound inside that section. So we‚Äôll be dragging a lot of the stuff that we add to this container. And that‚Äôs it for the primary structure. We have a section, and inside the section we have a container.¬†</p><p>Let‚Äôs move on to our text elements, and we have two that we‚Äôre going to add here. We‚Äôll add a text block, so this is a basic text block, we can drag it right into the container. And we want it, we‚Äôll double-click to edit the text, and we want it to say, ‚Äòwelcome.‚Äô And the second thing we want to add is a heading. Let‚Äôs drag in a heading right underneath. We‚Äôre in the container still, we want to put it right underneath the text block, and that‚Äôs our heading. We want it to say, ‚ÄòI create meaningful digital experiences that work,‚Äô or, ‚ÄòI live and breathe user experience design,‚Äô or, ‚ÄòI elevate user experiences using telekinesis,‚Äô which is better.¬†</p><p>Now, let‚Äôs control the spacing around our section, so that we can place our text elements exactly where we want to place them. If we select the section, by default, there is no padding, padding being the space inside an element‚Äôs boundary. Of course there‚Äôs also no margin, which is the space outside an element‚Äôs boundary. We want to add a little bit of padding on the top, and maybe a little bit of padding on the bottom, holding down Option on Mac OS or Alt to adjust padding on both sides at once. Let‚Äôs say, sixty pixels on the top and bottom, that looks pretty good for now. And now that we&#x27;ve added our text elements, we&#x27;ll move onto the Body (all pages) tag. Now, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs so powerful about the Body (all pages) tag: first, let‚Äôs select it. Let‚Äôs select the body element, we can just select the body element at any time, go up to the selector field, and click into Body (all pages). And when we‚Äôre here, we can set defaults that end up being inherited throughout the project.¬†</p><p>So we can change the default font, we can add new fonts, and we want to add two different fonts. The first one is Inter, so let‚Äôs go down here. Type Inter, and there it is. We‚Äôll include regular and six hundred, press add font. And the second font we want is DM Serif Display. So let‚Äôs go in, same thing here, DM Serif Display. And we‚Äôll choose just regular for our headings, let‚Äôs go in and add font. And once we‚Äôre done there, let‚Äôs go back to the Designer. Because this is where we‚Äôre going to build out the page. Now, again, body page selected, Body (all pages), let‚Äôs change our default font to Inter. And let‚Äôs change a couple other things while we‚Äôre here. Let‚Äôs change the background color, let‚Äôs do a sort of dark grey color. And of course we can‚Äôt see the actual text, which is a problem for legibility, so let‚Äôs increase that default color. Let‚Äôs go to white for now, we can always change this later. Because now that we have, we can go back and make some changes, now that these things are being inherited, to our heading. Let‚Äôs select our heading, let‚Äôs change its font to DM Serif Display, let‚Äôs select a weight of four hundred, the default there, and we can even set a maximum width on this. Let‚Äôs say we don‚Äôt want it to go above three hundred pixels, maybe a little higher. You can hold down Shift and the up and down arrows to jump by ten, let‚Äôs go to, four hundred fifty looks pretty good. Then let‚Äôs change our text block on the top, let‚Äôs change that instead of Inter four hundred, let‚Äôs choose six hundred. Let‚Äôs do all caps, we‚Äôll do capitalize all caps, and we can add some letter spacing, maybe. That looks pretty good. Decrease the font size, maybe to 12. There we go. We can actually select, with that text block selected, we can go down and decrease its opacity a little bit. Seventy looks pretty good.¬†</p><p>And once we‚Äôve done that we can move on to adding the hero image. Now, there‚Äôs something really important about the hero image. Well actually where we place it. Let&#x27;s go to our assets panel, drag in that hero image from before, and let&#x27;s drag it right into the container. And, by default, it looks okay. It‚Äôs being contained by the container. This is the parent element. Remember our structure over here in the navigator, we can see this inside our page body, we have a section, we added some padding to the top and bottom of that section, again we landed at about sixty. So, we have inside that, the container. The container is keeping everything neatly bound, neatly organized towards the center. We can affect its maximum width. We can say, maybe a twelve hundred pixel width is a little better. That looks pretty good, but what if we want this image to be full width? So with the image selected, we can click and drag, and instead of putting it in the container, we can put it in the section itself. Let go, now it‚Äôs taking up full width. In fact, if we grab the edge, if we grab the edge of the canvas here and resize, we can see it‚Äôs taking up more than the container width. It‚Äôs going all the way to the edges. In fact, if we were on a larger display, which we‚Äôll cover a little bit later, it would go all the way to the edges, even on an obnoxiously-sized browser. And we‚Äôll go over some more details about that later, but for right now we can see that it‚Äôs taking up full width. One thing we‚Äôre noticing right here is the heading itself is a little bit close to that image. We could just select the heading, add some margin on the bottom, maybe sixty pixels here, to space everything out evenly. But that‚Äôs it for now. We have the basic structure of our section set up. We added the text elements, we configured the Body (all pages) tag, and we added the hero image area. This is the bulk of everything we have above the fold. But, before we move on to the portfolio of work, the client projects, let‚Äôs build out our site navigation. Which we‚Äôll do in three, two...</p><p></p><p>One thing to remember: this is day one of a 21-day course. (Actually, two things to remember.) First, we almost always launch lessons EARLY on Webflow University. So if you want to get ahead, make sure you‚Äôre enrolled in the portfolio course there.¬†</p><p></p><p>As for the second thing, as you build your hero section, whether you‚Äôre following this lesson or creating or updating your OWN hero section, we want to see your work. And we want to SHARE some of our favorite work throughout this year. So Tweeter, Instagram (or as I call it, Instagrimur), use #21DayPortfolio. Throughout 2021, we‚Äôll be sharing some of our favorite work. As for me?

And, a note to anyone following along, we‚Äôve created clonable projects for each major lesson here. You can clone each step of the project along the way to dig in and see exactly how it‚Äôs built. It‚Äôs important to note that while we‚Äôre talking Sara is in the Figma project, iterating on a light version of this design. But, here‚Äôs the thing: because we‚Äôre using classes and the same HTML and CSS fundamentals used by the top developers all over the world, we can adapt to these changes right now, or along the way, or even later on. Our designs aren‚Äôt set in stone.¬†</p><p>This lesson will go pretty quickly. We‚Äôll add our navbar, we‚Äôll style it, and then we‚Äôll make a symbol. This way we can reuse it on other pages, and it‚Äôll always stay consistent. But, before we drag in the navbar, something to note about classes here, when we started modifying each of these styles, when we started modifying our heading, when we started modifying our text block, it automatically created classes. What this means is, if we copy and paste or even add a new text block later on, and we make a change to any one of them, let‚Äôs say we change the padding, let‚Äôs say we change the font, let‚Äôs say we change the font size, just holding down Option and dragging here, notice it&#x27;s affecting each instance of this, each text block has the text block class applied. So any time we add the text block class to something, it‚Äôll follow suit. Now, this is terrible. Nobody uses Impact anymore. Let‚Äôs remove that font change. In fact let‚Äôs just hit Command Z and undo all the way back to the beginning.¬†</p><p>But that&#x27;s a quick note on classes. Let‚Äôs add a navbar element. We can just drag in from components here, and we can place this right in our body. We can actually place things in the navivagor over here. Let‚Äôs place it right underneath the page body, and we have some defaults. The first thing we can do is click the container, and we already created a container class too. You can see the container was already created for us when we set that maximum width of twelve hundred. So if we select this, and go in here, and we can just click Container. And now it‚Äôs set that same maximum width. In fact, if we make a change here, hold down Option, we drag that maximum width, notice how it&#x27;s affecting the container up here, and it&#x27;s affecting the container down here. We can change either of them. Let‚Äôs put it back to twelve hundred, and that‚Äôs pretty good for the navbar.¬†</p><p>And once we&#x27;ve done that (once we&#x27;ve added the navbar) we can move onto styling the navbar. We can style the navbar however we want to match our hero section. Let‚Äôs change some other stuff too. Let‚Äôs change the background color, maybe for our background color we can do a solid black. Let‚Äôs do that for now. And, these aren‚Äôt very legible over here, but we‚Äôll take care of those in a second. Let‚Äôs first do our logo. So here‚Äôs our logo, .SVG, let‚Äôs drag that right into this Brand Block where our logo can be placed. And, it says Megan Garcia Portfolio, we can make that a little bit smaller. Let‚Äôs close this out. That looks pretty good, we can always change this later. But, let‚Äôs also make sure it‚Äôs centered. So with our Brand Block selected, we can add some padding on the top and bottom. And the reason we‚Äôre doing this is we want to increase, we want to increase the size of that Brand Block, this clickable link so that when people press it, it takes us back to Megan Garcia‚Äôs homepage. So let‚Äôs increase that. Looks pretty good at maybe sixteen pixels. And, we‚Äôll make another change. Over here with the links, let‚Äôs of course change the color, we can go to a red, we can go to a pink, we can change it to anything we want. Let‚Äôs make ours a white color for now. And, we could just apply that same class again (this is the Nav Link class, it was automatically created when we made that change to the white color) and we can apply it to all of these. And the reason - oh that‚Äôs not correct - let‚Äôs go back in, hit the Backspace, Delete button, and instead make sure we‚Äôre doing Nav Link. That‚Äôs correct. And if we change the padding on any of them, again it‚Äôs affecting the padding on all of them. This is why we use classes. We don‚Äôt have to manually style element by element, by element, by element, by element. We just change it once, on the class, and it affects each element that has the Nav Link class applied. So, we can actually delete this one. Let‚Äôs change this one to Projects, and this one to Say Hi. Now, we might want the last one to look a little different. In fact, let‚Äôs say later on we add another link here, let‚Äôs say it says About Me, and we want the third one to be a little different than the other ones. Well, we can create what‚Äôs called a combo class, and this is essentially something built on top of the Nav Link class that we created. So we can say this one‚Äôs called a Nav Link button. And we can style this one a little different. Maybe we want to change the background color on this to, let‚Äôs keep it white, let‚Äôs lower the opacity a little bit, and maybe we want to decrease that padding. Maybe round the edges a little bit. Let‚Äôs set this to five or six. And maybe we want to add some margin on the top. Let‚Äôs say twelve pixels for now. And, something to note about combo classes, again this is Nav Link button, but it‚Äôs based on Nav Link. So if we go to any of these that have the Nav Link class applied, we decrease the padding, let‚Äôs say we decrease it to, let‚Äôs do fifteen on each side. Let‚Äôs do fifteen on the left and right, or twenty on the left and right. Notice how this Nav Link button now has twenty pixels. It‚Äôs inheriting that. In fact we can click this, this little amber-colored label. We can click, and we can see that it‚Äôs value is inherited from the Nav Link. It‚Äôs inheriting that even though we created a combo class on top of it. Now, for this design, let‚Äôs remove About Me. We used that to demonstrate what the class versus the combo class does, but for now let‚Äôs move on to the final step here, which is creating a symbol.</p><p>Now, a symbol once created can be used all over the project. Let‚Äôs demonstrate by selecting the navbar. Again we can even select stuff from the navigator here. Let‚Äôs select the navbar, and with the navbar selected we can go over to our symbols panel, and we can press, Create a New Symbol. And we‚Äôll call this, Navigation. Here‚Äôs what happened. Suddenly we‚Äôre editing the symbol. But, let‚Äôs go back to this particular instance of it. So you can see it‚Äôs just an element, it‚Äôs turned green here, but let‚Äôs copy and paste, just to demonstrate for a second. Copy and paste, that symbol, so we have two instances of the symbol, and we can edit a symbol by double-clicking on it. We double-click to edit the symbol. And when we make a change in here, let‚Äôs say, we add a new button, and another button, and another button, notice how what‚Äôs happening up here is reflecting any one instance of that symbol. So we‚Äôre affecting our navigation symbol. Any one instance that‚Äôs changed will affect all other instances of that symbol. For now, let‚Äôs delete this project, this project, and this project‚Äôs Nav Link. And we‚Äôll go back to the instance. And let‚Äôs delete that second navigation symbol.¬†</p><p>But that‚Äôs it for navigation. We added the navbar, we styled it, and we made it a symbol so it could be reused as many times as we want. And, we can change these things down the road, but for right now, we‚Äôre going to move into one of the most exciting parts of this entire build: a client project section that&#x27;s driven by visual CMS. This is how you can design one user experience, and different versions of that experience are built out using magic.¬†</p><p>[Sara] And science.</p><p>[McGuire] And science.</p><p>[Grimur] From my dreams. I can see everything. And I can see your navbar ideas. In my mind. Give me your ideas.

That means we can link parts of our design, we can connect placeholders to that data.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Those data.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Those data.</p><p>But this means we‚Äôre able to design faster, and we can add new items that adhere to the designs we build out. And, we‚Äôll do this in five parts: we‚Äôll set up the basic structure, we‚Äôll create our CMS Collection (this is the database of project), we‚Äôll add content to that Collection, we‚Äôll show how we can use the CSV to more quickly import that data --¬†</p><p>[Sara] Those data</p><p>[McGuire] Those data.¬†</p><p>And finally we‚Äôll build out our design referencing the items in that Collection, which really does feel like magic. Let‚Äôs start with the structure. Same basic concept as before, with the top section, let‚Äôs grab a section element. We&#x27;ll use the navigator this time to place it at the bottom, we‚Äôll put it right here, underneath our existing section, and with this section we‚Äôll use the same class. We‚Äôll go over to the selector field here, and we‚Äôll type in section. And when we do, we bring along all those style values from before. We‚Äôve got the sixty pixels on the top, and the sixty pixels on the bottom. This is padding, space inside that element. And we want to do something else here. We want to add a heading. Let‚Äôs drag in a heading. We can drag it right into that section. This time we want it to be an H2, our top level heading on the page. I elevate user experiences using telekinesis, that‚Äôs our H1, our top level heading. This one will be an H2. And, let‚Äôs double-click and edit that to say, Selected Projects, and a few things we can change here. First off, let‚Äôs change our styling. Of course, we could use our heading style from down below. We can also duplicate that class, so this can be secondary heading, and decrease the font size since it‚Äôs an H2, twenty-eight pixels. And if you notice over here on the left side, the H2 goes all the way up to the section. And that‚Äôs because we haven‚Äôt yet added our container. So the other part of our structure is going to be the container element. Let‚Äôs go up and add a container. We want to add this inside the section, and of course if we grab our secondary heading, and put it inside, we have our container, keeping everything neatly bound. Now, notice how it does not match the container in the nav bar, or the container in here. That‚Äôs because those are using the container class. With our container down here selected, let‚Äôs go up and make sure the container class is applied. Now it matches. Again, at any time, we can change something like the maximum width, and it affects all containers using that class. We‚Äôre fine with twelve hundred. One more text element to add here. Let‚Äôs add a paragraph. This paragraph can be basic, lorem ipsum, we can use placeholder paragraph text. Maybe get rid of some of it. Let‚Äôs stop here. And we can even set a maximum width. Over here we set a maximum width of four fifty, so maybe on this paragraph here we can set another maximum width of four fifty, like that. Now there‚Äôs a ton of space here, our secondary heading has that sixty pixels that we used on this heading. So for our secondary heading let‚Äôs decrease that maybe to twenty pixels or even ten pixels might be okay, fifteen. And, with that paragraph selected, we might want to drop down that color. Just decrease it‚Äôs opacity maybe to, let‚Äôs see, so we‚Äôre using our contrast ratio checker here. If it‚Äôs this low, it&#x27;s a little low, let‚Äôs put it up to maybe sixty percent looks pretty good on this paragraph. That‚Äôs looking okay, at least while there‚Äôs a black background. If we change this later, for instance if we change this section‚Äôs background color, or we change all our section‚Äôs background color to red, of course that contrast won‚Äôt be high enough now. If we go in to edit that text color, we can see it‚Äôs failing. We‚Äôd have to increase that white color, even at full it‚Äôs failing. Also, this is hideous and it sears the retinas. Let‚Äôs change it back. Command Z, undo, very quickly, very quickly, very quickly.¬†</p><p>Well, we built it once. Let‚Äôs build it again, but faster. Command Shift Z to redo. And we‚Äôre back. But, there‚Äôs one more thing to notice here. We created spacing here, we created padding of sixty pixels on the top here, we created sixty pixels underneath this heading, between the heading and the image, between here and the end of this section is another sixty pixels. But, if you look at this section, sixty pixels doesn‚Äôt go all the way down to that heading. If we click our secondary heading here, we can see there‚Äôs twenty pixels of margin. Let‚Äôs remove that. So it‚Äôs even and matched. But we can always change this stuff later.¬†</p><p>But for right now, let‚Äô s move into creating our CMS Collection, and this is the part we describe as magic. So, let‚Äôs go over here to CMS on the left side, and let‚Äôs create our Collection. And our Collection name is going to be Projects. And we want to add some fields. First off, this name will be the project name. Each of these Collection fields will hold the data for each project. So we want to make sure we‚Äôre listing out fields for every type of data we want to track. So, for clients, we‚Äôre going to want a brief description. Let‚Äôs go to plain text. And we‚Äôll say this is a brief project description. If we want to add an image, maybe an image for each project, let‚Äôs go to image, and let‚Äôs say project image. Let‚Äôs add another field. Maybe for each project we want a different color. So let‚Äôs say project color. We can design with this color. It could be unique, it could be matched to each project. Let‚Äôs add another field. This time with an option dropdown, this can be the type of project, or project type. And, let‚Äôs add a few options. Maybe we do illustration; let‚Äôs add another option for web design. These are all the types of projects Megan wants to feature. Maybe prototyping. And finally let‚Äôs add one more for general UX design. So four options, let‚Äôs save that and add another field. We want to add the year, let‚Äôs do a plain text field for project year. Another plain text field for the name of let‚Äôs say, client name, the name of the client on that project. Let‚Äôs add another one for the project details, rich text, project details. We can show these on each project page. And just two more. Let‚Äôs add a field which is a link. We want a link to the project, so we‚Äôll call it project link. And one more, final field, let‚Äôs add multiple images. So for each client project, we want to be able to add multiple images. Let‚Äôs say project images. And here‚Äôs what happens: when we press, Create Collection, suddenly we have this blank database and we can add a new project. That‚Äôs taking the name new project, that‚Äôs the project Collection we just added, let‚Äôs press New Project. And suddenly, we can add one of Megan‚Äôs projects.¬†</p><p>Now, for Megan‚Äôs first project let‚Äôs type, investment-app. Slug is okay. Brief project description, we have something on our clipboard already. Let‚Äôs drag in an image here, so we have this investment app, we can just add the Bluerock.jpg here, we‚Äôll just drag it right in. We can paste in a project color. The type of project is a UX design project. The project year is 2021. The client name is NewStar Dollars, and the project details, we can type these or just paste them in from something like GoogleDocs. Let‚Äôs paste that right in. And for the project link, let‚Äôs make it Google.com for right now. Finally, for project images, let‚Äôs go back and add the other ones we didn‚Äôt add. So let‚Äôs deselect Bluerock, drag these four right in, and that‚Äôs it. We‚Äôve added four images to this multi-image field. And that‚Äôs it. We can press Create, and now we‚Äôve created that investment app client.¬†</p><p>Now, there‚Äôs a faster way to do this. If we have all the data in something like a CSV or any type of spreadsheet, let‚Äôs move over to Google Sheets here, we can say hey, maybe we have the project names and these descriptions, we have them all written out in a spreadsheet. So, we can say, let‚Äôs remove the investment app right here, maybe reorganize them, although we can do it right inside of Webflow if we want, but the important part is that we export the data, we save it as a CSV, a comma separated values sheet. Go to File, go to Download, Comma Separated Values. And, back in Webflow, we can import this, right into our Collection. We can just drag that CSV we just downloaded right in. And, the reason we deleted the one we already typed in is because we don‚Äôt want duplicate projects. We had four, all of them listed in the CSV, but we typed out the first one together. So now we‚Äôre importing three in that CSV. We‚Äôre going to indicate that top row is indeed the header, and we‚Äôll hit Continue, and we‚Äôre just going to match each of these field types. Most of them already lined up. If we have a few brief descriptions, which we want to map to a field, sometimes this happens if it&#x27;s not named exactly how we named it when we made the Collection. Let‚Äôs make sure this goes to brief project description. And then project color, that&#x27;s correct. Project type, let‚Äôs map that too. And finally let‚Äôs link that link to project, let‚Äôs map the link to project to the project link field. When we‚Äôre ready, we can import those three projects, and we‚Äôve imported all our CMS content. Press Close, we have all four right here. Now, up on the top right here, we can click this little pin icon, and we can add the project color, we can do the project year, we could do the project link, well they‚Äôre all Google right now. Let‚Äôs do project description, and we can preview all the data in our database inside our Collection right here. Now we‚Äôre ready for the magic part.¬†</p><p>So, let‚Äôs close out of the CMS, and we‚Äôre back in our main page. Let‚Äôs go and add a Collection list. Now, a Collection list references a Collection. It‚Äôs just a list of things from that Collection. So let‚Äôs put it under the paragraph. You can see we have three kind of placeholder Collection items, but we need to link this to our projects. This is the list of CMS Collections, we have one, our projects Collection. Let‚Äôs click that. Suddenly you can see right here, we have a list of each of the four projects. Each project we added to that database, to that Collection. Here‚Äôs the impressive part. We can go ahead and drag in something like a heading, let‚Äôs drag that into any of these fields, doesn‚Äôt matter which ones. Put in architectural website, since it‚Äôs in the H2 category, since this is the H2 and we‚Äôre still in the same section, let‚Äôs make these H3s. And, nothing really impressive right now. It just says heading four times. But, if we click this little cog, and we actually get the text from, we go to get text from, we can link this to the project name. And suddenly, we have a list of each of these. Let‚Äôs go ahead and add in a paragraph. Let‚Äôs go in, drag in a paragraph element, again we‚Äôre placing this in the Collection item. So, any of them we can put in, social network, this one in this Collection item right underneath, social network, again by default it‚Äôs just a paragraph but we can get that text for that paragraph from the brief project description. Again, creating a link between these headings and these paragraphs, and the data in our Collection. Let‚Äôs add another one. Let‚Äôs add a text element, this time text block right above the heading. Let‚Äôs make this the project type. And, one more text block, let‚Äôs add a text block at the bottom here. Again, inside each of these Collection items we have a text block on the top, we have a heading, we have a paragraph, let‚Äôs put that at the bottom, and let‚Äôs call this one, let‚Äôs just name it view project. Notice how as we‚Äôre doing this on any one line it‚Äôs affecting all of them, and that&#x27;s because when you make a change in any one Collection item, it affects all other Collection items. So it affects the architectural, the social network, the meditation app website, and the investment app.¬†</p><p>So, let‚Äôs do a couple things to design this the way we want to design it. First, let‚Äôs make sure our Collection item is selected and what we‚Äôll do here is do a couple things. Let‚Äôs first make sure we have a Div block inside that Collection item. A Div block is just a rectangle. It does what we tell it to do. We can put things inside that rectangle. We can put things outside that rectangle. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Let‚Äôs drag those four things. The Div block is going to contain our text block. Let‚Äôs put in our heading, let‚Äôs put in our paragraph. We‚Äôre just putting that paragraph right inside the Div block, and the text block we can put that in too. So the Div block now has all four of our elements. Here‚Äôs why this is important. We can select the Div block, and set its background color. We can go to element settings, and get its background color from our projects, from that particular project color. We can see, we‚Äôre now styling these things. It doesn‚Äôt look great yet, but we‚Äôre now styling these things based on each Collection item&#x27;s data, like the background color. So maybe with our Collection items selected, go back to element settings, let‚Äôs just add some margin at the bottom, maybe thirty pixels. Let‚Äôs collapse this Div block because we want to do one more thing. We want to add an image. So let‚Äôs get an image element, let‚Äôs drag it not in the Div block but under the Div block, and let‚Äôs get that image from our project image field. Now, it‚Äôs kind of taking up all the space available right now. It‚Äôs not very good looking. So, what we can use is CSS grid. We can select our Collection item, this is the parent element that contains that Div block that has all of those data inside, and it has the image. It has the image element inside. So with our Collection items selected, let‚Äôs change our display to grid. And, by default, we have four cells. Let‚Äôs remove that bottom row, right-click, and Delete Row. Let‚Äôs increase the spacing to maybe thirty pixels here, let‚Äôs press Done. Now we have this kind of side-by-side design. In fact, we might even want to get rid of that. Let‚Äôs actually remove this spacing altogether. Looks good. We have this kind of side-by-side design, so we can select our Div block here, maybe add some padding, let‚Äôs do thirty pixels on all sides. That looks pretty good. Maybe we want View Project to be at the bottom, so with this Div block selected, let‚Äôs name it. Instead of using the Div block default class name, let‚Äôs call this Project Details. And, we can add flex box to this. Flex box lets us sort things in any one of two directions. So if we want to sort things vertically or horizontally, we can click flex box. This is horizontal, but we can switch this to vertical. And, what flex box allows us to do since we set it on the project details, the Div block that parent, we can select any children of that parent,. So let‚Äôs open this up, click that text block, and we can set it‚Äôs top margin to auto. And that pushes it all the way down to the bottom.¬†</p><p>So, couple more things. Let‚Äôs select our Heading 3, and you can do this on any of them our Heading 3, let‚Äôs add a class, let‚Äôs call it Project Name Preview. And we can set a different font on this, let‚Äôs set the font to DM Serif, let‚Äôs do a weight of four hundred, let‚Äôs decrease the font size to twenty. Twenty looks pretty good. And for these top text blocks, let‚Äôs decrease the opacity. Let‚Äôs drop these a little bit. That looks pretty good. Same thing here. We can apply a lower opacity. And, for organization‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs make sure as we‚Äôre making these new classes, as we‚Äôre changing each of these items, we‚Äôre keeping things organized. So let‚Äôs say this is, Project Type Preview. And we might want to change this parent element. Let‚Äôs go into the Collection item, let‚Äôs hit Edit Grid, or we can just go up to the top here, and hit Edit Grid, and maybe we want to move this over. So let‚Äôs change this, these fraction units, actually point seven five is pretty good. We can always click in, and point eight. That looks okay. Let‚Äôs hit Done. And so we‚Äôve kind of offset our design here. So we have a description on the left, with the view project button, which we‚Äôll add in a moment. Again we should say this is button text. And we have all four projects added right here.¬†</p><p>Now, we‚Äôve set up a visual hierarchy here. Where our H1 is clearly the big headline, the H2 is on a second level, and each of these H3s is on a third level. And the nature of our Collection list, the way we have each client project following the same structure, that lends itself to visual repetition. Repetition establishes rhythm in our design, and it makes scanning through our projects clear and easy to preview. And like we said, the great thing about building it this way, is not only can we change the design down the road, but as we change stuff in our database, in our Collection, the design is going to update to reflect those changes. Now, we‚Äôre making huge progress, and we‚Äôre even nearing the end of the work on the homepage. In fact, after this we‚Äôre just adding two more parts. The contact form, and the footer. And then we‚Äôll go through the entire homepage to make sure it‚Äôs responsive on different devices like tablets and mobile phones.¬†</p><p>[Grimur] Hang on. I‚Äôm texting. I mean I‚Äôm reviewing some of the hero sections and navorgations on Tweet-hir. And Insta. Using the hashtag #21DayPortfolio. But I actually mistyped the hashtag, which is profoundly embarrassing. But yeah.

Remember, you can clone each step of this project at any time to see exactly how we built it. But for this lesson, we want to cover the most critical part of any portfolio, which is a clear call to action, a CTA. And right now, while people can see what our UX Designer here, what Megan has done, there‚Äôs no way to actually get in touch. And when it comes to developing a strong CTA, we find it helpful to follow a pattern based on the user‚Äôs story. As a person, I want to learn or do something so that I can achieve a specific goal. For a UX Designer like Megan, her ideal person, a user visiting her portfolio might be a business owner or product manager. And what they want to learn or do could be different depending on the motivation, the intention of Megan‚Äôs potential clients. Maybe they want to learn about her process, maybe they want to get a price range, or maybe they just want to validate her experience, or explore the quality of her work. And the reason they want to do all those things, the action we want them to perform, is to hire Megan as a UX Designer. And this is what Sara‚Äôs design does extraordinarily well. So, what‚Äôs the call to action? If they‚Äôre visiting this portfolio we want our information architecture, all the content on the site, we want it all set up in such a way that it makes it clear what she does ‚Äî¬†</p><p>[Sara] Above the fold, right in the heroes section.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] We wanted to show them the quality of her work --¬†</p><p>[Sara] The hero image in the Collection list.</p><p>[McGuire] And of course, we want to make it really clear how to get in touch.¬†</p><p>[Sara] We didn‚Äôt build that yet.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] That‚Äôs right. And that‚Äôs our motivation behind designing and building a contact form. It‚Äôs not just a checkbox in web design that we happen to do because others do it. It‚Äôs a carefully thought-out decision that&#x27;s based on Megan‚Äôs potential clients. It specifically designed to help them validate Megan‚Äôs work and to reach out to hire her. That‚Äôs the goal. So, we‚Äôll do this by adding a form block, we‚Äôll do a configuration of our form, and then we‚Äôll style it to be consistent with Sara‚Äôs design.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Um, I‚Äôm not Megan.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] We know.¬†</p><p>[Sara] I know you know.</p><p>[McGuire] Then what‚Äôs wrong?</p><p>[Sara] It‚Äôs just, Grimur‚Äôs unsure.¬†</p><p>[Grimur] I don&#x27;t even... Who&#x27;s the designer?</p><p>And finally, just like we did for our navigation, we‚Äôll make the form a Symbol. That way we can use it on different pages throughout the project. So let‚Äôs add our form block. We have two sections, we have our top, our heroes section of course, we have our second section, this is the one that has the Collection list with all the client projects inside. Let‚Äôs add a third section. We‚Äôll just drag in a third section underneath the other sections, and we‚Äôll apply our section class. We‚Äôve created a section class. So, let‚Äôs do that. So we have our padding, sixty on the top, sixty on the bottom. And let‚Äôs drag in our container. That‚Äôs the second part that keeps everything neatly organized. Of course, we‚Äôve made a very specific container class called container. And once that‚Äôs added, we can add the form block inside. Let‚Äôs drag the form block into the container itself. And that‚Äôs it. Cut to black.¬†</p><p>	So, by default we have two items in here. We have a name, and an email address, we want to add another field. Let‚Äôs go ahead and add a third field. Let‚Äôs do a text area, so we can add a message for Megan. And let‚Äôs close that out for now, and we‚Äôll add a field label. We‚Äôll add a form field label. We‚Äôll put that above. So we have three things here. Let‚Äôs make this one message. Email address is fine. And let‚Äôs go ahead and create classes. Again, classes are automatically created when we make a style change on something. So if, for instance, we make this all caps, and we decrease or increase the letter spacing and decrease the font size a little bit, it‚Äôs already created this class for us called field label. So we‚Äôll just go over here, and we‚Äôll add field label. Over here, even faster, just hit Command Enter, or Control Enter on Windows, and we can just type field label. There it is. And of course, now that we‚Äôve made each of those classes, we‚Äôve applied each of those classes, we can change any one of them and all are affected. Maybe eleven looks pretty good. Okay.¬†</p><p>	So, a couple things with our form. Let‚Äôs select our entire form block and let‚Äôs start changing some colors here. We can change the text color to black. Of course we can‚Äôt see anything right now, so let‚Äôs change our background color to a lighter color, let‚Äôs do kind of a light grey color here. And let‚Äôs also, on the form block itself, let‚Äôs add some padding. Let‚Äôs do thirty pixels on all sides. And let‚Äôs also add a heading. Let‚Äôs add a heading into our form block. We can put it right up here. And we‚Äôll call this, Let‚Äôs work together. Now, we already created a style. All the way up here we created a style for secondary heading. Let‚Äôs apply that down here. Notice how this secondary heading is a white color. Our default, if we see where that white color is being inherited from, press color, it‚Äôs coming from the body (all pages) tag. So, what that means is we can go here, and apply secondary heading. And notice how it‚Äôs pulling that color from the form block. Let‚Äôs add one more thing, which is going to be a paragraph underneath that. Let‚Äôs go to paragraph, let‚Äôs drag in a paragraph underneath that heading, and let‚Äôs look up here, see if we have any styles that match what we want to use here. We do have a lower opacity paragraph, probably not. Let‚Äôs go ahead and create a lower opacity with the darker color. And let‚Äôs take a look at our contrast ratio, anything up here is going to be double A, triple A, if we go up to let‚Äôs see, seven point one nine. That looks pretty good. Let‚Äôs call this, dark paragraph. And let‚Äôs add some more spacing underneath, thirty pixels. And if we want these to be side-by-side we can drag in a grid. So let‚Äôs drag in a grid element right here. And let‚Äôs delete this second row that comes with this. So we have a side-by-side design. Let‚Äôs press Done. And we‚Äôll use a Div block for this. Let‚Äôs grab a Div block, and we can drag it anywhere we want. Let‚Äôs put it inside that new grid. And the Div block is going to hold each of these items. So we want the Div block to hold the name. So let‚Äôs click and drag name into that Div block. And we want that text field also in that Div block underneath the field label. So, these two are in one block, that‚Äôs taking up the first cell. We want one more block. So let‚Äôs grab another Div block, grab a Div block, in our grid, let‚Äôs put it next to it. In fact we want this one first. So let‚Äôs grab our email address, drag it into the Div block, and let‚Äôs grab that text field, and drag it into that Div block. So, what is our structure? We have a grid, with two cells inside. In cell one we have a Div block with the name, and the name field. The second one we have the email address, and the corresponding field to that. Message is staying outside, that‚Äôs looking pretty good. Finally the last thing we want to do here is make the submit button stay on the right side. Just like we used flex box up here in the project details Div block, we can do the same thing down here. In fact, with the form element selected, we can make that flex box. And when we do, everything is kind of messed up here. We want to make it vertical, and then we can take that Submit button and override. We can override it‚Äôs full width default. We can go to alignment and order, and we can just set it to go to the end right there. And maybe we want to change the background color, we can set it to #657C3. And, so we can reuse that color in other elements, other styles, let‚Äôs call that it the main brand color. And we‚Äôll create a swatch, that‚Äôs reusable all throughout the project. And we‚Äôll add some rounding, maybe a radius of five pixels. If we want to push it off from the top here, we can add a little bit of margin on the top. Let‚Äôs do fifteen pixels on the top. And that‚Äôs looking pretty good.¬†</p><p>Now, for our final step, let‚Äôs select our form block and we‚Äôll go ahead and make it a Symbol. This time we‚Äôll right-click on the label on the canvas, and we‚Äôll go down and create a Symbol. We‚Äôll call it contact form. So, we added our contact form, we configured the fields, we got everything styled, and we just made the form a Symbol so we can reuse it on other pages later. Up next, we‚Äôll build out the final homepage section, the footer, and after that we‚Äôll wrap up our work on the homepage by making everything responsive.¬†</p><p>[Grimur] Wow, guys.

Now, could we just add the Navbar we already created to the bottom of the homepage?¬†</p><p>[Sara] No.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] But yes.¬†</p><p>[Sara] See, this is why I was worried.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] No need to worry. Now, if we wanted to add the Navbar at the bottom--</p><p>[Sara] What?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] You‚Äôre texting me.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yeah.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] We‚Äôre filming.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Read what it says.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] No.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Read what it says.¬†</p><p>[McGuire, reading] Follow the design.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Now, continue.¬†</p><p>We‚Äôll set up our footer structure, we‚Äôll design our new footer, and of course we‚Äôll make it a Symbol. And let‚Äôs look at our current structure. We have four main parts inside our page body. We have the navigation, we have the first section, we have the second section (which is our selected projects), and of course we have our third major section, which is the contact form. We‚Äôre going to add, you guessed it, another section. Let‚Äôs drag in a section element. We‚Äôll do that under all of the existing sections, and let‚Äôs add, like we‚Äôve gotten used to doing, our section class, and of course, we‚Äôll put a container inside that element. Of course, we‚Äôll add our container class, and now everything‚Äôs the way we need it to be. So that‚Äôs our structure.¬†</p><p>Let‚Äôs add the footer elements. So, there‚Äôs a few here. One, we might want to just add a logo, just a logo on the top right here. If we want all of our elements inside the container to be centered, we can do that. Let‚Äôs just use a Div block for this. Let‚Äôs add a Div block inside the container. We‚Äôll call it footer holder, and let‚Äôs start putting things like this inside of that. Let‚Äôs just resize this to be a little bit smaller, a little smaller than that. And, with our footer holder, let‚Äôs use flex box. We want these things to stack vertically when we put stuff inside of our footer. We want it to stack vertically. Let‚Äôs choose vertical. And we want to align everything to the center. So, let‚Äôs add additional elements. Let‚Äôs add our paragraph underneath the image, underneath the logo. Maybe we want some space, let‚Äôs select that logo, add some space underneath. Let‚Äôs add maybe thirty pixels. We can set a constraint on the footer holder itself, we can say the maximum width is only fifty percent of the parent element it‚Äôs in, inside of the container. And, that could work. That‚Äôs one way to do it. We could also undo that, and instead add padding on the sides. Now if we don‚Äôt want all of this to go as wide as it‚Äôs going, we could select the paragraph and we could center it. Maybe add a maximum width of six hundred pixels, and that looks okay. Maybe we don‚Äôt need all that text. We‚Äôll use placeholder text for now, but we could replace this later. That looks a little bit better. And let‚Äôs add a Collection list. Let‚Äôs add some lower navigation here. So we‚Äôll add a Collection list. Put that inside the footer holder, and by default, we want to link to our projects. And this time we only want a link for each of them. Let‚Äôs use a link block. A link block is like a Div block, except it‚Äôs a clickable link. Let‚Äôs add it inside of each Collection item, so we have a clickable link. And then inside of each of those, we want to add a text block. So let‚Äôs use this, let‚Äôs place it inside the link block, with that text block in the link block. Right now it has that kind of hideous, terrible contrast, blue underline.¬†</p><p>And we can change this. With our link block selected, we can go in and edit &#x27;All links&#x27;. Let&#x27;s do that. We can scroll down and turn off that underline, we don&#x27;t want that. And let&#x27;s choose a color for this. Any color we want, maybe white is okay for right now. And let‚Äôs select that text block inside, and link it. We‚Äôll link it to the project name. So in the dropdown, let‚Äôs choose project name. And now we have a list of all our projects. Let‚Äôs go back into the Collection list itself, and here‚Äôs where we can use grid again. Let‚Äôs go back up, with the Collection list selected, let‚Äôs press grid. And by default it‚Äôs giving us a two by two, but let‚Äôs see what happens if we remove one of those rows and add two more columns. Now we have this sort of grid-based layout, with each of our items inside. And, with our grid controls here we can align each of the children, we can justify and align to the center. And now, we have a list of each of our items. Let‚Äôs add some more margin here, let‚Äôs do thirty pixels. We have a list of each of our projects at the bottom. Now, one more thing here. This footer holder is the parent element of quite a number of things. But the section itself, we can use what we learned earlier, with a combo class. In fact, let‚Äôs go and add to the right section, let‚Äôs say, footer. So we‚Äôre using all of the style properties of section, but we‚Äôre adding on using this footer combo class. Let‚Äôs change the background color to our main brand color. That looks pretty good.¬†</p><p>Let‚Äôs add one more thing to this, and this is a list of three. Let‚Äôs use a Div block for this. We‚Äôre going to add our social media buttons. So, let‚Äôs close this Collection list wrapper. Let‚Äôs add this Div block, move it underneath, and we‚Äôll call this social wrapper. And we‚Äôll put three link blocks inside. One for each of the social buttons we‚Äôre going to have. So, we‚Äôll have one, that‚Äôs copy and paste. Actually, before we do that, let‚Äôs add an image. Let‚Äôs add Twitter first, let‚Äôs add that inside the link block. We‚Äôll use that default size, that‚Äôs fine. And then right before we copy and paste, let‚Äôs add a class to this link block. Let&#x27;s call it social link, and then, with the social link selected, let&#x27;s copy and paste, twice. So we‚Äôll double-click and change this, we‚Äôll replace this second image with the instagram logo. We‚Äôll do the same thing, double-click, replace the third logo. This time with LinkedIn. Now, remember we added the class social link. So with social link selected, you can scroll up and add some margin on both sides, holding down Shift to space these out really evenly. Let‚Äôs do ten pixels on each side. So, with these social links, we can click this cog icon here to open the link block&#x27;s settings where we can link out to each of our social channels. Let&#x27;s close out of that for now. Our social wrapper here could use some space, so let&#x27;s add some margin. Maybe 30 pixels of margin on the top there. That looks pretty good. Maybe we want to select that Collection list, maybe this grid-based Collection list, and instead of Inter four hundred, let‚Äôs switch it‚Äôs children to Inter six hundred.¬†</p><p>And of course, we can keep building, we can keep designing. But let‚Äôs make this a Symbol so we can reuse it elsewhere. Again with the section selected, let‚Äôs create Symbol, we‚Äôll call this footer. And that‚Äôs the last section. This is the last part of the homepage, the last thing we‚Äôre adding for now. We did the footer structure, we configured and styled everything inside, and we made it a Symbol. Up next, we‚Äôll take everything we‚Äôve built here and we‚Äôll check responsiveness and fluidity to make sure our homepage works on tablets, mobile devices, and even much larger displays. But remember, at any time you can clone each stage of this build to dig in and follow along with exactly what we‚Äôve done along the way. Or even use any cloneable project as a starting point for anything you&#x27;re looking to build.¬†</p><p>[Grimur] Share your work. We‚Äôll share our favorites.

And, we‚Äôre going to take all of this and ensure it‚Äôs both responsive and fluid on all different devices. We‚Äôll do this on Desktop, Tablet, Mobile landscape, Mobile portrait, and we‚Äôll add a larger breakpoint for devices like the iMac or the Pro Display XDR, and on other larger displays.</p><p>Let‚Äôs start with Desktop. Up here this is our base breakpoint, this is the default breakpoint from which we design everything else. We can grab the edge right here and test fluidity, see how everything‚Äôs responding. And something to note right away, we created that custom container, and that custom container, which has the container class, has a maximum width of twelve hundred, and that works pretty well. But things get really close to the edge here, so what we might want to do is add some padding. Let‚Äôs say twenty pixels on both sides, so that it‚Äôs not going right up to the edge. In fact if we want it squared off, we might want to make it thirty pixels on each side. Now if we test responsiveness, if we test fluidity, it looks like it works on all different widths. We can see right here this is the iPad Pro, the twelve point nine inch, we can widen here, this is the Retina Macbook, the twelve inch, or the earlier Macbook Pro, twelves at the bottom, over here is Macbook Air eleven inch, this is Macbook Pro the earlier fifteens, and this is the Macbook Pro thirteen and the Macbook Air thirteen inch models. Looks good on all these widths. Let‚Äôs scroll down, let‚Äôs see how these are performing. They look pretty good. Let‚Äôs check our contact form and our footer. All of it seems to be working great on all of these widths.</p><p>Let‚Äôs move on to Tablet, and just by glancing at it, Tablet actually looks okay. We might want to adjust the section, that sixty pixels on the top and bottom with that more limited real estate, might want to drop that to maybe thirty pixels on the top and bottom. Let‚Äôs do that, see how this responds. Looks pretty good here. We can see that by default our nav bar has switched to dropdown navigation, so let‚Äôs go into¬† preview mode, and let‚Äôs click that little hamburger menu. And we might not love this color. So let‚Äôs click out of preview mode. Let‚Äôs double-click, we‚Äôre going to edit our Symbol, let‚Äôs click the menu button. We can go over to our element settings, and we can open that menu. And with our menu button selected, let‚Äôs make it a different color. Let‚Äôs say black, but we can choose any color we want here. Black looks pretty good. And let‚Äôs select our nav links. Again, we have two different classes here, we have the nav link and then we have the nav link button class. So we might want to make them more even. So let‚Äôs say the padding on the top and bottom, let‚Äôs make it ten pixels on the top and bottom and the nav link, same thing, ten pixels on the top and bottom. And there‚Äôs some space here, so if we click that nav link we still have that margin on the top. Let‚Äôs remove that and let‚Äôs change the nav link color here. Also let‚Äôs just do black. That looks pretty good. The second one here, let‚Äôs change that to black. Remember, we&#x27;re affecting the combo class (that‚Äôs Navlink AND Button). It&#x27;s grayed out right now, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s carrying over that opacity we did when we were styling on the base breakpoint, when we first made it. Let&#x27;s bring that all the way up, so it&#x27;s a solid black color. And we‚Äôre still getting that rounding, so let‚Äôs turn off that rounding. Now it should work okay. We should be able to go in here, trigger that open menu, close menu. Open menu, close menu. That seems to be responding just fine. So, Tablet, how are we doing with responsiveness and fluidity? We‚Äôre looking pretty good on each of these. Even as it gets more narrow, it‚Äôs looking pretty good. This form looks great. This footer looks great. That‚Äôs Tablet.¬†</p><p>Let‚Äôs move on to Mobile landscape. Things are getting a little tighter on Mobile landscape. Let‚Äôs maybe decrease this heading. So decrease this size, let‚Äôs make it twenty-four, maybe a little higher, thirty. And decrease our line height, let‚Äôs use unitless, and let‚Äôs choose something like one point one. That looks pretty good there. The container seems to have some space underneath. Is it that heading? Yeah that sixty pixels. Let‚Äôs make that thirty. And now, if we go back here, we can see even -- well we do want to change that, the heading here still had the sixty, let‚Äôs change that to thirty -- but even as we make changes to these smaller breakpoints, notice how they‚Äôre not affecting, we made the heading size thirty, but that didn‚Äôt affect the Tablet. That‚Äôs because changes start on the base breakpoint, and they cascade down to smaller devices, and they cascade up to smaller devices. So a change we make on Tablet will affect Mobile landscape, but a change we make on Mobile landscape won‚Äôt affect Tablet or Desktop. So we‚Äôre on Mobile landscape, this is looking pretty good. There‚Äôs a lot of space here. Maybe this section, thirty is a little tight, let‚Äôs maybe make that fifteen. Decrease the H2 size since we decreased the other one. That looks a little better, twenty-two, maybe on this we can decrease that a little more. That looks good. We can actually select our paragraph, maybe we want that a little tighter as well. Maybe thirteen pixels. We do that here as well. You know these side by sides might not work. We can notice that even over here, if these things are getting too narrow, you don‚Äôt see it that much on Tablet. Here‚Äôs the question: what‚Äôs going on here? Why are each of these images clipped off? Well, if we go back to Desktop, you‚Äôll notice we never actually set a height here. The height is being determined by the image inside. So if we make these widths two hundred pixels, notice how it‚Äôs actually clipping everything off. In order to do this properly, we might want to make a different change. We might want to select this image element, and make its width one hundred percent, and its height one hundred percent. And right now it‚Äôs a little squished, but its respecting the content on the page. Here‚Äôs what that means. Let‚Äôs add some extra content. Notice how as we add more paragraphs, it‚Äôs stretching, the image is stretching to take up the space that‚Äôs created by all this extra text, and as we undo that it squishes down. One thing we can do with this image selected is we can set it‚Äôs cover, it‚Äôs fit to cover. And now it‚Äôs going to clip off and respect those dimensions. So how do we set a different dimension? How do we set these to be a little bit taller? We can just go in, and select the project details Div block here, and we can set it‚Äôs height to something like, let‚Äôs do minimum height so it doesn‚Äôt clip anything off, let‚Äôs set it to five hundred pixels. That‚Äôs looking pretty good. And here‚Äôs what that did in mobile. Notice how now, that side by side, it‚Äôs still clipped off but it‚Äôs no longer shrinking that image. That image is always taking up the space inside the grid. And that‚Äôs being determined by this Div block. Let‚Äôs go back to Tablet, maybe we want to make this three hundred. That looks pretty good. Let‚Äôs go to Mobile landscape, and in Mobile landscape, we might not like the side by side design. It looks pretty good here. Maybe we want to make it half and half. So let‚Äôs create one, let‚Äôs make this 1FR. Let‚Äôs see what a side by side looks like. That looks pretty good. Let‚Äôs see. As we resize, this looks pretty good on Mobile landscape.</p><p>Let‚Äôs try Mobile portrait. Okay, it‚Äôs a little too tight here. Let‚Äôs go in and edit our grid, and let‚Äôs remove that second column. But where did our image go? We set its width and its height to 100%. And because we REMOVED that second column, we&#x27;re left with a 1 by 1 grid. But we have this invisible row here that contains our image, right now it has 0 pixels of height. So the image is taking up 100% of those 0 pixels. So now, let‚Äôs change a minimum height, let‚Äôs say two hundred pixels, now we can see the images again. Let‚Äôs go in, let‚Äôs maybe remove that spacing here. This is looking pretty good. So we have each card, maybe we can decrease this minimum height, just remove that minimum height, let‚Äôs just do¬† auto. That&#x27;s looking pretty good. Maybe we can push off the button text here. Let‚Äôs push off on the top, create fifteen pixels of space. This is looking pretty good. Each project has its image, and its description. Let&#x27;s check our contact form, and our footer. Too tight here as well. Let‚Äôs go into contact form, that grid we created before, let‚Äôs remove that column. So now we have everything that should stack nicely. Let‚Äôs escape, contact form looks okay. What about this Megan Garcia Portfolio? Actually before we move onto that, let‚Äôs double-click the Submit button, let‚Äôs make it take up the full width. That looks better. And we‚Äôll hit Escape, and for this portfolio footer, let‚Äôs resize. It doesn‚Äôt look too good as things get narrow, so let‚Äôs go in here and let‚Äôs take this Collection list, which is also a grid, and let‚Äôs remove three of the columns. It just automatically creates rows, one row each for each of these. And that looks, each of these. And as we test responsiveness and fluidity, now it responds just fine. Another thing about the container, thirty pixels, it looks pretty good, but as this gets narrow that&#x27;s a lot of space. Notice how this little menu bar icon is also moving. So let‚Äôs change each of those. From the container, let‚Äôs decrease this padding. Let‚Äôs do maybe ten pixels, that looks okay. So as we resize, that looks good. Maybe the spacing in between each of these looks good at thirty. We could go in and go to our Collection item and change that from thirty to maybe ten as well. That looks good. And let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s going on with the button up on the top, the menu button. As this gets narrow, the logo is pushing that menu button to the right. So we could do a few things. The easiest might be to take Megan Garcia Portfolio, setting a different width on Mobile portrait here. Let‚Äôs do one hundred fifty pixels, little bit smaller, and we can select our brand and add a little more space. Let‚Äôs do eighteen on the top and bottom. Maybe nineteen on the top and bottom, that looks pretty good. And if we drag and resize now, let‚Äôs hit Escape to go out of that Symbol, even on the narrowest device, everything works okay.¬†</p><p>Now, here‚Äôs one of our favorite parts. If we go into preview mode, regardless of what breakpoint we‚Äôre in, we can click and drag, to reflow through all of the breakpoints. Notice how we‚Äôre in Desktop, now we‚Äôre in Tablet, Mobile landscape, Mobile portrait: it goes through all of them to test responsiveness and fluidity of all our elements. Fully responsive design on all of these.¬†</p><p>Now what if we want to create a larger breakpoint? Well we can do that too. Let‚Äôs go out of preview mode, let‚Äôs go up here, and we can add larger breakpoints. Twelve eighty, fourteen forty, or nineteen twenty, let‚Äôs add nineteen twenty for much larger displays. Now, something interesting just happened. We‚Äôre on a Pro Display XDR, but the window size is roughly nineteen twenty by nine sixty. It‚Äôs at 2X, it‚Äôs at retina when we‚Äôre capturing this so we can capture in 4K, but notice how we are looking at a width of nineteen twenty. Then we have this other number right here, this seventy-six point seven percent. Webflow has scaled all the elements on the page, so we can simulate what it will look like on a larger breakpoint. In fact, if we grab the edge right here, we can click and drag even more to see what it looks like on a larger screen. Maybe three thousand pixels wide. Let‚Äôs decrease that. We can go all the way back down to show nineteen twenty pixels in a canvas this size, on our browser, even if we‚Äôre on a smaller display, it‚Äôs had to scale down the elements. And that‚Äôs okay. It looks good. We could maybe increase the container width to, let‚Äôs say, sixteen hundred pixels, just widen that out. That looks pretty good. Maybe we want a larger heading on our larger display. Let‚Äôs switch it to maybe fifty-six, and let‚Äôs increase that height. Let‚Äôs use unitless, one point two, we‚Äôll use a little hyphen here, Enter. One point one might be better. And, let‚Äôs get rid of that maximum width, let‚Äôs make that a lot wider. So we‚Äôre going to increase that to seven eighty. That looks good. Selected projects, maybe our H2s can get bigger. Again, let‚Äôs do one point one hyphen, and then let‚Äôs increase that. That looks a lot better. Maybe with our paragraph selected some more space at the bottom, we can change these things a little bit later. Let‚Äôs do thirty. That looks pretty good for now. But, that&#x27;s our larger breakpoint. Again, we can go to preview mode and we can see all of this in action. Let&#x27;s grab the edge, we can click and drag and we can see what it looks like on 1920, Desktop, Tablet, and mobile devices... Now, we always want to switch back to our base breakpoint. We want to do all of our basic designing, all of our standard designing in the base breakpoint. And then when we‚Äôre testing responsiveness and fluidity and we&#x27;re building different designs, as we‚Äôre adjusting our designs for each breakpoint, then we can switch over to Tablet, Mobile landscape, we can go back up to our nineteen twenty. We always want to go back to our base breakpoint when we add new elements and style. That‚Äôs our starting point. But, with that we‚Äôve completed our first pass on the homepage. Is it one hundred percent? It‚Äôs pretty close. We‚Äôre definitely going to revisit it. But there are two other pages we want to build out. We‚Äôll build out a project details page, details about each project in Megan‚Äôs portfolio, and we‚Äôll add a separate contact page we can link to throughout the project.¬†</p><p>[Sara] You know what I‚Äôm thinking?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Yes.</p><p>[Sara] No you don‚Äôt.¬†</p><p>[McGuire stares]</p><p>[Sara] Okay, what am I thinking about?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] On three.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Okay.

Because up until now, we‚Äôve built out our homepage (a single, static page that has dynamic projects that show up in the section...that has projects). And we‚Äôll come back to it later, but we want to build our second page, and there‚Äôs a secret. We‚Äôre not just designing one page. We‚Äôre designing one page...which will serve as the design for all client pages to be automatically created. Unlike the homepage, this page is not built from static elements. In fact, we‚Äôll use a lot of the same linking we used in the Collection list (in our projects list on the homepage) and we‚Äôll build out this design once. But the result will be unique pages that are automatically generated for every project.

This is not the correct hero Section, because we‚Äôre still on the homepage. But, to get to the right hero Section we have to make it, and we‚Äôre going to make it on our Collection page. Here‚Äôs how that works. If we go to the CMS over here, we can see our Collection we created earlier, projects, and of course we have our four Collection items, each of the projects in Megan‚Äôs portfolio. So, if we go out of this, let‚Äôs go out of CMS Collections, and go into our pages panel. We can see under CMS Collection pages, a projects template has automatically been created. That happened because we created projects. So if we open that, it‚Äôs entirely blank. But there‚Äôs something else going on. If we go up here we see this little dropdown called item, and this is each of our Collection items, but right now it‚Äôs blank. But just as we used the Collection list earlier, to list each of our client projects, a page has automatically been created based on each of our client projects., and we can link to those pages. Here‚Äôs how to do it. We‚Äôll stay on investment app for right now, and let‚Äôs design it as if we‚Äôre only designing one static page. We‚Äôre going to pull that data from the Collection. So, let‚Äôs add a Section, we‚Äôve done this before, let‚Äôs add our class, it‚Äôs called Section, there we go.</p><p>Let‚Äôs add our Container, so we‚Äôre getting pretty good at doing this, of course we have our class, Container, and of course we‚Äôre going to add two elements inside of that. Let‚Äôs add our heading, let‚Äôs put that right inside the Container, and we‚Äôll add a text element, just do a little text block right underneath that heading, also inside the Container. We‚Äôre going to do something different with each of these. In both cases we‚Äôre going to pull the text from the Collection. So for our heading one, let‚Äôs grab the project name. So instantaneously we‚Äôre on the investment app page so it says investment app. And for this text block, let‚Äôs grab the type, the type of the project, let‚Äôs go to project type. So here‚Äôs what we have: investment app, this was a UX design project for Megan. If we switch over to architectural website, also a UX design project. If we switch over to social network, that was a prototyping project, and if we switch over to meditation app, that was a web design project. So, already we‚Äôve created four pages by just creating one. Okay, we haven‚Äôt created one but we‚Äôre close. We‚Äôre not very close, but we‚Äôve just gotten started. Let‚Äôs continue. And we have a good starting point for the types of headings we want. In fact if we use our secondary heading class from before, that‚Äôs a pretty good starting point. Instead of building on top of that, let‚Äôs create a duplicate. Let‚Äôs duplicate this class, let‚Äôs call this Project Page, maybe Project Heading, and that looks pretty good. We have size twenty-eight, let‚Äôs lower that height a little bit, let‚Äôs use unitless one hyphen. That looks pretty good there. Let‚Äôs apply the same to this. Let‚Äôs call it Project Heading.</p><p>The space is a little dramatic between the two of these, let‚Äôs decrease that from fifteen, to maybe five. And for this one we‚Äôre going to use a combo class. So both of these right now have the same class applied. In fact if we change the size on one of them it changes it on both of them. That‚Äôs what zero pixel size looks like. That‚Äôs what seven hundred nineteen pixel size looks like. Let‚Äôs bring it back, undo, and select our second heading, Web Design. We‚Äôre going to create a combo class. We‚Äôre going to call it Secondary. And what this is means is, it‚Äôs a more specific styling than our project heading. So, if we want to make this one darker, let‚Äôs just make it darker. We just change our color. Let‚Äôs drop this, until right, right when we get triple A four point five four contrast ratio. That‚Äôs pretty good.</p><p>We have this darker grey, or we have this lower opacity white, against our dark background. Now, again, this is the base class. They have the same base class, project heading here, project heading here. That means if we go back to project heading, and we make a change to one of them, so if we change the size, it‚Äôll still affect both. But, if we pick the more specific one, project heading secondary, a change here will not affect the first one. Let‚Äôs undo that, so they‚Äôre both even and matched with this one having a slightly lower opacity. A dramatically lower opacity. Fifty-five percent lower opacity. Now there‚Äôs one more thing we want to add to this hero Section.</p><p>Let‚Äôs make that an image element, and we‚Äôll drag it into the Container for right now, but we can place it in the Section like we did on the homepage. So, with this image selected, let‚Äôs add a class. We‚Äôll call it Project Main Image. But, more importantly, let‚Äôs get the image from our Collection. So let‚Äôs check this box, Get image from our projects Collection, and let‚Äôs choose project image. Now, this is the image from the meditation app website, and if we switch over to the investment app, that‚Äôs the image from the investment app website. In fact, we can hold down Shift Option on Mac or Shift Alt on PC and hit the left and right arrows to swap between each of our Collection items. We‚Äôre loading up a different page, a different web page, that‚Äôs automatically being built for each of these. So, as we style and populate one page, it‚Äôs doing that for all the others as well. So let‚Äôs land maybe on this one for right now, Investment App. And let‚Äôs configure this image further. So, Project Main Image, this is the class that‚Äôs applied to it, let‚Äôs set our width. In fact if we pull it out of our Container and into the Section, it‚Äôs kind of large. So, let‚Äôs do a couple things. Put the Container on top of that, so that our Project Main Image is on the bottom. Let‚Äôs set a height of, let‚Äôs say four hundred pixels. Now, the reason that image is no longer one hundred percent, is because it‚Äôs preserving the aspect ratio, the relationship between the image‚Äôs width and height. And there‚Äôs a way around that. We can set the height to four hundred pixels, but we can also set the width to one hundred percent. And when we do, it sort of stretches. If we actually go back to that sun image, let‚Äôs go back, Shift Option left, there we go. We can see the sun is stretched way out of proportion. So, to fix that, let‚Äôs use object fit. And here‚Äôs how object fit works. It lets us take these dimensions which we‚Äôve already set, any element that has a width and a height, and it‚Äôll fit the content to that. It‚Äôll fit this image to what we specify. Let‚Äôs choose cover, and just like that, the image is preserving its aspect ratio, but scaling up to cover the box we‚Äôve defined, that box defined by one hundred percent width and four hundred pixel height. Let‚Äôs Shift Option, left and right, take a look at all of these, they‚Äôre all proportional. We can see in this one it‚Äôs kind of showing this cloud, kind of floating there. It‚Äôs fitting for social network. This works fine.</p><p>So, let&#x27;s continue. Maybe with our UX design, we‚Äôll add a little more margin at the bottom, and again, we‚Äôre just affecting the secondary version of this project heading. So it‚Äôs okay that we‚Äôre applying this to that class only. Let‚Äôs do maybe sixty pixels. That looks pretty good. So, we have a Section, inside that Section we have a Container, inside that Container we have the heading, and we have that text block, and then we have our Project Main Image. One last thing, let‚Äôs make this maybe five hundred.</p><p>That‚Äôs one topic down. Let‚Äôs move on to our second topic so we can add details for each of these projects. Let‚Äôs add another Section, we‚Äôll go to Section and drag that underneath the existing Section, and we‚Äôll add our Section class.</p><p>Again, this is carrying over that sixty pixels of padding on the top and bottom. This is consistent across all pages in our project. And, let‚Äôs add our Container. Instead of going to the add panel each time, let‚Äôs hit Command K or Control K on Windows, and we‚Äôll use quick find here, we‚Äôll just type Container. Now we have a Container. And we‚Äôll add our class to this, Control Enter to quickly get to the selector field, and we‚Äôll type, Container. There we go. We have our Container, inside our Section. Now, if we look at our Figma design we can see a sort of side by side. There are a thousand ways to build this. We‚Äôre going to use CSS grid as the top-level organizer, our side by side, and then we‚Äôll have an element inside each cell. Let‚Äôs put in our grid. Let‚Äôs go to the add panel, we‚Äôll drag a grid, and we‚Äôll place it inside the Section and inside the Container we just created. And there‚Äôs our grid. It‚Äôs a two-by-two by default, we do not need that second row, delete. And that‚Äôs the structure for our side by side. Let‚Äôs hit done, and we‚Äôll rename this, we‚Äôll say this is our Project Side by Side. There‚Äôs probably a better name for it but we know what we‚Äôre talking about. And, for this Section we‚Äôre going to drag in a Div block. This is going to be our content organizer, we‚Äôre going to place all of our content inside this Div block. So it‚Äôs going to hold everything else. So, what do we add inside the Div block? Command K to enter quick find, and we‚Äôll get a text block. And before we configure everything else, let‚Äôs copy and paste so we‚Äôll have six of these total. One, two, three, four, five, six. And let‚Äôs style it first to differentiate. First off, our first, third, and fifth are going to be styled using Project Label. And our default font size is okay here, but let‚Äôs change it to all caps. We‚Äôll go to more type options, and capitalize. That‚Äôs pretty good. Maybe semibold. And we‚Äôll apply that label here too. Let‚Äôs do project, label, we‚Äôll do the same thing here. Command Enter. Project Label. Now for the other ones, let‚Äôs create a new class, let‚Äôs call this Project Info. And this one we‚Äôll choose a more transparent color. Let‚Äôs pull down to, right at triple A, sixty-one on the alpha looks pretty good. And we can apply the same thing here, Project Info. Command Enter. Project Info.</p><p>If we want to go even quicker we can select sibling elements using the left and right</p><p>arrows, so we can just go down here to this bottom text block, Command Enter, Project</p><p>Info.</p><p>And on each of these, with any of these elements, with Project Info selected, let‚Äôs add some margin on the bottom to space these things out. Twenty pixels looks pretty good, maybe even, maybe even some more, just referencing our original design here. Let‚Äôs do sixty pixels on the bottom. And, let‚Äôs double-click and change the text. This‚Äôll be our client, this‚Äôll be project type, project year. And we can just pull that information right from our Collection. Let‚Äôs get this text from the client name. For our second one let‚Äôs pull that from the client project type, we‚Äôll get our text from the client project type. And for the third, of course, we want to grab the year. Same deal here. Get the text from the year. Now, if we hold down Shift and Option, and go left and right, we can see, in fact, let‚Äôs hide this main image. Let‚Äôs turn it to display none for a second. We can see if we swipe left and right, as we switch through from item to item, that the project year, the project type, the client is changing out. Now, we don‚Äôt want to forget about that. Let&#x27;s undo, let‚Äôs remove that styling of display none so we have the picture back. That‚Äôs good.</p><p>But each of these pages are already building themselves. And a change to any one of them, let‚Äôs say on these project labels we want to add a little more spacing underneath, maybe five pixels or ten pixels of spacing underneath. Maybe we want to increase that spacing between the letters, the letter spacing to one or even two.</p><p>That‚Äôs project details. Let‚Äôs move on to the project description. We‚Äôll go to the add panel, and we‚Äôll add rich text and we can put this next to the Div block, let‚Äôs put it on the right side. And before we link it, let‚Äôs make a couple changes here. Now, in our Collection we have two types of elements that we added inside of each project description.</p><p>We have an H2, a heading two, and we have a paragraph, so let‚Äôs do that. Let‚Äôs configure each of those here. And to do that, we‚Äôre going to do something special. With the rich text block selected, let‚Äôs create a new class called Project Description. And when we created that class we unlocked something special. This is an H2, if we select that, it says styling rich text. That‚Äôs because this H2 is actually inside a rich text element. So if we select our H2, we can select a tag in here, and we have this option to change our H2 headings. Now, this a lot of control but here‚Äôs how it works: all we have to do is start styling, so if we want to change our font to DM Serif Display we can do that. Let‚Äôs choose our font weight of four hundred. But there‚Äôs something interesting to note. For the sake of example, let‚Äôs change this color to pink. And we‚Äôre doing this to demonstrate that if we add another H2 somewhere else in the project, let‚Äôs add a heading, let‚Äôs put it underneath, and let‚Äôs make it an H2. Now, everythings still pink. All our H2s are still pink, but that‚Äôs expected. Let‚Äôs go back to our H2, this one right here, and let‚Äôs go into our all H2 headings tag, we‚Äôll remove the pink color.</p><p>Now everythings back to the way it was, and now that we‚Äôre selecting this more specific H2 heading inside of a project description, we can change it. So if we want to change it to pink, we can make it pink. And notice how it‚Äôs not changing anything else in our project. It‚Äôs not affecting these H2s. That‚Äôs because it&#x27;s affecting all H2 headings when nested inside of a project description. Now, that‚Äôs advanced. It‚Äôs a really specific way of styling. You don‚Äôt have to have separate H2s, H1s, you don&#x27;t have to have these things separate styled differently inside of all of your rich text fields. We‚Äôve chosen to do that because we want to make some specific changes to H2s inside here. First off, we don‚Äôt want it pink. We‚Äôre going to remove that color here. We also want it to be a little bit smaller, let‚Äôs say twenty-eight pixels, with a height, let&#x27;s use unitless one point one hyphen. And now we want to do the same thing with the paragraphs. Let‚Äôs select our tag, the paragraphs tag, and we‚Äôll choose the nest selector option here. Let‚Äôs press that. Again, we‚Äôre only affecting what paragraphs look like when they‚Äôre nested inside of a project description. And we‚Äôll make a couple changes. Let‚Äôs use unitless again, maybe one point three hyphen, one point, four, five, that looks pretty good. And let‚Äôs change the font size a little bit, thirteen, and we‚Äôll change the color. Let‚Äôs reduce the opacity, this color, to triple A minimum, which is seven point one three. That looks pretty good.</p><p>Maybe some more space if we select this heading again. Let‚Äôs add some space at the bottom, thirty pixels. Now, two more things. Let‚Äôs delete this rogue heading, delete. And the last thing, let‚Äôs select our project description, let‚Äôs select our rich text field, and let‚Äôs link it to our Collection. So, if we go into our cog, get the text from project details, it‚Äôs nonsense. It‚Äôs lorem ipsum but it&#x27;s correct and it&#x27;s linked to our Collection now. And to prove that we can go through, we have unique Collection items, with unique lorem ipsum for each of them. Let‚Äôs go to our meditation app, that has its unique lorem ipsum, with its H2 and its paragraph. And we have the social network with its unique lorem ipsum with its H2 and its paragraph. And these pages are automatically being generated based on what we built so far. Now two things to note before moving on. One, this H2 is not aligned to the top of client. To do that, we‚Äôll need to unlink. So we can just quickly ulink, and select our H2, again we‚Äôre selecting all H2s when nested inside a project description. Let‚Äôs just remove that top margin, and that‚Äôs better aligned. When we‚Äôre ready, we can just select the project description, select that rich text, and link it back to the project details.The second thing to note is that we want clients to be able to click through and actually look at the link of the completed work in our portfolio. So, to do that we‚Äôre going to add a link underneath.</p><p>Now remember how we set up the structure. To the left we have this Div block, with labels and the info underneath each of those labels, and then on our right side we have this rich text field. We want something underneath that rich text field. So just like we did on the left, we can use a Div block to organize our content. Let‚Äôs put a Div block right in here, and by default a second row is created. We don‚Äôt need that, so let‚Äôs just grab our project description, and put it in Div block. So two Div blocks, the one on the left, is our left cell, contains all this information, the one on the right, now contains our project description. Let&#x27;s add one more thing underneath that. Let‚Äôs add a link, we‚Äôll add a link block, and we‚Äôll do that right under the rich text. Now, two things we‚Äôre going to put inside that. Command K, text block. One more thing. Command K. Image. Let‚Äôs choose our image, we‚Äôll go to choose image, we‚Äôre going to use that little arrow we imported earlier. Let‚Äôs make it a little bit smaller. That looks pretty good.</p><p>And for our text, let‚Äôs change that to View project. Now if we want these things side by side, there&#x27;s a number of ways to do it. Let‚Äôs just select our text block, and change it to inline block. We can say this is text inside link, and of course, we can add some margin on the right to push off that arrow from the text. Maybe decrease that arrow size a little bit more, we might want to set some negative margin to pull it up slightly, maybe minus three pixels, or minus four. That looks pretty good for now. We can always go back and tweak later. With our link block selected, the parent element here, let‚Äôs make sure it‚Äôs linking to the right place.</p><p>Let‚Äôs go in and get the URL from our projects, so the place it‚Äôs going to take people is our project link. That means when someone visits this page, social network prototyping, and they read the project description, when they press View project it‚Äôll take them to the example project, to the link that we specified for this project. Also, if we want to open in a new tab, how do we do that? We check the box that says open in new tab.</p><p>But that‚Äôs our project description. Let‚Äôs add our multi image grid. And we‚Äôll do a basic version of this for right now.</p><p>Let‚Äôs go in and add a Section, again we‚Äôll add one underneath our other Sections, and we‚Äôll add our Section class, Section. We‚Äôll go quicker here, Command K, Container. Command Enter. Let‚Äôs add the Container class. And we want to add one thing inside our Container, it‚Äôs a Collection list. So we‚Äôll do Command K, Collection list, return, and we can grab from our source, we can grab that multi image field. Let‚Äôs press project images, and by default we can‚Äôt really see anything inside. We need to add an image. So let‚Äôs go in and add an image. We‚Äôll drag it into any one of these. Let‚Äôs do this one. And as we know from our Collection list earlier, we can get that image right from our Collection. Let‚Äôs select project images. Now, they&#x27;re very large by default. That‚Äôs okay. But how do we make it not full width? How do we make it a grid? Well we can just select our Collection list right over here, and we can press grid. And just like that, we created a two-by-two grid. It‚Äôs desaturated, and washed out. That‚Äôs because we‚Äôre editing the grid. Press done. No longer desaturated.</p><p>Let‚Äôs name our Collection list, so it doesn‚Äôt say Collection list two, let&#x27;s name it Image Grid. And something to note, at any time, if we go into our style manager here we can see there are some things we haven‚Äôt named properly like image two, image three. We can go back as we want to clean up, and rename those things. For now, let‚Äôs do the best we can to keep things organized. So this is an image grid, and if we want to control things like the height we can do that. So, by default it‚Äôs respecting the aspect ratio of each of the images. But, sometimes that&#x27;s not always going to be the case. So, the width is taking up that cell by default. The height, let‚Äôs set it to four hundred pixels. And again we learned this before, we can do one hundred percent width, and we can use object fit. Let‚Äôs use cover. And, that allows us to change the height, just holding down Option or Alt and moving left or right to adjust the height on each of these images. And the grid is conforming. Now, one thing to note, we can edit our grid, let‚Äôs go to edit grid, and let&#x27;s change our grid gaps here. Let‚Äôs do, we can do no gaps whatsoever, let‚Äôs do thirty pixels to keep it consistent with our other padding and margins options in this project, let‚Äôs do thirty on all sides. Press done and now we have a two-by-two grid. Now if there are more images we add later, it‚Äôll continue to add rows. We can always, with our image grid, with our Collection list selected, we can always limit the number of items. So we can limit to two. Notice how that only shows two inside of our gird. We can do four. Let‚Äôs keep it at four right now. That way if we add more images down the road, if we add more images to this client project, it‚Äôs not going to overwhelm our design and create rows upon rows upon rows. Just two.</p><p>But that‚Äôs our multi image grid. Let‚Äôs move on to other projects. And again, these are going to link out to other projects Megan has done. Let‚Äôs collapse this Section, and add a new Section underneath. We‚Äôll put it underneath this one. Command Enter, let‚Äôs add a class, Section. We‚Äôre getting good at this part. Command K, Container, add a class, Command Enter, Container. And we‚Äôll also add another Collection list. This is going to be a list of all our other projects. So we can go to source, we can go to CMS Collections, we have this project Collection right here, and automatically its been populated by all of our projects, including the one that we‚Äôre on right now. The social network. That‚Äôs okay we‚Äôre going to limit it in just a moment. So let‚Äôs build this out. Let‚Äôs select, let‚Äôs go and open up Container, Collection list wrapper, there we go, Collection list. Let‚Äôs make this a grid. There are three columns, and only one row. Let‚Äôs remove that second row. Now, it‚Äôs creating an automatic row by default because it‚Äôs showing four, but we can quickly limit this.</p><p>Let‚Äôs go into our element settings, and add a filter. This lets us choose for our project, we want to make sure that our project is not our current project. The current project is social network. So if our project is not social network, it‚Äôs not going to show social network down here. Just as if we switch over to investment app, it won‚Äôt show investment app down here. The other thing we can do before we move on, let‚Äôs name this &quot;Other Projects&quot;. And as we know, all we have to do is design one of them and they all design themselves. Let‚Äôs go in and add an image. We‚Äôll get the image from our Collection for the project image, and just like that, we have an image for each of our projects. Again, these aspect ratios are not the same. So we could select one of them and say, project image, width one hundred percent, height we‚Äôll say three hundred pixels, maybe three hundred fifty pixels looks good, and let‚Äôs of course use object fit. Let‚Äôs choose cover. And underneath the images lets add a Div block. We‚Äôll grab a Div block, we‚Äôll add it underneath, and we‚Äôll set a background color, we can grab that background color from our projects. Let‚Äôs grab the project color so each of them corresponds to the color we set in the Collection. And we‚Äôll add two things inside each of these Div blocks. We‚Äôll add the type of project, let‚Äôs do a text block. And we‚Äôll get that text from, let‚Äôs move that up here, we‚Äôll get that text from the type of project. Close that out. And we‚Äôll do the project name, again Command K, we‚Äôre opening up quick find here, another text block, and project name. Let‚Äôs style it.</p><p>So with the first one selected, in fact, it might save us time, it might be easier to edit this if we select our Div block first. Add some padding. Let‚Äôs do thirty pixels on all sides, for our top one. We have a great style up here we used for project info. Let‚Äôs choose that, let‚Äôs use that class, project info. We can use a combo class, let‚Äôs use other, so we can remove that margin, we don‚Äôt have to use the same margin we used on the original project info. Maybe add actually a little bit more, maybe ten pixels on the bottom. Then for our second text block, let‚Äôs add another class. We can even use our project heading from before, project heading. That‚Äôs not how you sp- no- do not ask again. Heading. Let‚Äôs add a combo class smaller, and decrease that size a little bit. That looks pretty good. Maybe a little less space between project info, let‚Äôs do maybe five pixels here. And two more structural changes before we‚Äôre done with this Section. Let‚Äôs add a heading, so we‚Äôll go in and grab a heading, let‚Äôs place it inside our Container, and that can be hard to place on the canvas sometimes. So let‚Äôs just drag it into the navigator underneath Container. This‚Äôll be an H2, and we‚Äôll call it &quot;Other projects&quot;. Now, let‚Äôs add a class, we can use the class we originally created earlier in the course, we can just use heading here, has a nice margin underneath of sixty pixels. That looks pretty good in this Section. The second thing we want to do structurally, is make these clickable. We want anyone to be able to click on the UX design, this architectural website, or the social network and actually go to see those project details, to see that project page.</p><p>So how do we do that? We use a link block. We‚Äôll drag a link block right into the Collection item. And all you have to do is move the project image, and that Div block we‚Äôve created, inside the link lock. The link block essentially turns anything into a clickable link. Anything inside a link block becomes a clickable link. So, with our link block selected let‚Äôs link that, not to a URL, but this little button right here. Which lets us link to a specific page, choose a Collection page, we‚Äôre going to choose current project. And here‚Äôs what that means. It‚Äôs going to link to the current project that&#x27;s associated with that link. So if we click on architectural website, it‚Äôll take us there. Lets prove that. Go into preview mode and we‚Äôll click architectural website, again we‚Äôre on investment app. Let‚Äôs click architectural website, and it took us to architectural website. Go down here, meditation app, it takes us there. Go down here, investment app, you get the idea.</p><p>That‚Äôs one more topic down. We‚Äôre on to our last topic which is adding our Symbols. This will be the quickest topic because we‚Äôve already created the Symbols elsewhere in our project. So all we‚Äôre going to do is add them to this page. Let‚Äôs go into our Symbols, and we‚Äôll add our Navbar, we‚Äôll add our Navbar right in the page body at the top. So, Megan Garcia portfolio, that‚Äôs consistent. We know about our footer, let‚Äôs add that, let‚Äôs grab our footer and put it at the bottom of the page underneath all the other Sections. That&#x27;s good. And there&#x27;s one thing we‚Äôre missing which is of course, our contact form. Now, watch what happens when we let go. It takes up the full width by default. Our pattern here is that we want that contact form to exist in a Section. Now, the Symbol doesn‚Äôt include a Section. It‚Äôs just the form itself, plus all its children .You can double-click, take a look inside, that‚Äôs the form block, and all the things inside that form. So, to do that, let‚Äôs do what we‚Äôve done for the rest of this project. We‚Äôll grab a Section, we‚Äôll add the Section class, Command K, quickly add a Container, Command Enter, let‚Äôs add the Container class, and then we‚Äôll drag this contact form. We‚Äôll drag it right into that Section, right into that Container. And that is it. Now, we need to make all of this responsive but first let&#x27;s step back and recap what we just did.</p><p>We built not one but four different pages using magic, and this will get even more important</p><p>in the next few lessons as we wrap up and add additional work to the portfolio.</p><p>We built our hero Section, our project details, our project description, we built an image</p><p>grid, we listed and linked to other projects, and we added our Navbar, our footer, and our</p><p>contact form.

Let‚Äôs start on Desktop and test responsiveness and fluidity. If we grab the edge, kind of move it from the left and right, we‚Äôre looking pretty good up here. Let‚Äôs scroll¬† down, take a look at how this is responding. Again, we have our container, so it‚Äôs keeping everything neatly organized, neatly bound towards the center with that margin. And again we hit thirty pixels there, and it starts resizing. That looks pretty good. Our grids nice and responsive. What about these? Also looking pretty good. Down to our contact form and our footer. So, Desktop looking solid.¬†</p><p>Let‚Äôs move on to Tablet. Now, one thing to notice when we switch from Desktop to Tablet: this investment app, the UX design, this right here, looks visually centered for the most part, vertically centered. If we go to Tablet it doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs because in our section, if we remember way back to the beginning of this course, the padding on Tablet changes to thirty. So, for UX design, this kind of combo class here, let‚Äôs reduce that sixty to thirty. Keep things a little more even and matched. Maybe our project main image doesn‚Äôt need to be five hundred pixels, something like three hundred pixels ought to do. Let‚Äôs check fluidity, this looks pretty good. Project type. One thing to note here, on this limited real estate, it might not make sense to do a side by side. Actually catching right here if we look down at this image grid, this is thirty pixels on all sides, it&#x27;s consistent. But notice how this is not. So let‚Äôs go back to Desktop. Let‚Äôs select our grid, let‚Äôs edit that, and let&#x27;s make sure this is also thirty pixels. Now if we go on Tablet, that&#x27;s even and matched, but we might want to use some of that real estate. Let‚Äôs switch over and make this one point five FR. That looks pretty good. Let‚Äôs look at our images. Those are nice and responsive. Other projects, those might be a little bit tall. Now notice how this isn‚Äôt taking up the full height. Let‚Äôs see why that&#x27;s happening. If we click other projects, it is a grid, so to find out why let‚Äôs select our Div block. And we can see the Div block is a child of this link block, along with the project image. And the project image has an explicit height set. It doesn‚Äôt matter what that height is. Notice how social network is not taking up two lines, so it&#x27;s not an equal height. To do that, let‚Äôs select the link block and we can already see its boundary is not taking up the full height either. So, we could set its height to one hundred percent, but notice how the Div block still isn‚Äôt taking up the available room. This is a perfect candidate for flex blox. So with our link block selected, again, with the Collection item, we‚Äôre affecting all other Collection items too, so this is also now a link block with the link block class. But, with our link block on any of these selected, let‚Äôs go in and choose flex box. That does not look good. Let‚Äôs make sure things are stacked vertically. And, all we have to do is select our child, the Div block, which is again a child of the link block, and choose our sizing option here. We want it to expand, we want it to grow if possible. Press that, problem solved. Now, the project image height, is that okay? We kind of just chose two thirty-five, that looks pretty good, maybe a little bit less. Let‚Äôs- two hundred. It‚Äôs responsive, equal height layout. That‚Äôs looking pretty good. Our contact form is looking good here too on Tablet, and of course, we‚Äôve already configured our footer which doesn‚Äôt need the space anyway. That&#x27;s great for Tablet.¬†</p><p>Mobile landscape.Things are getting a bit tighter here. So, let‚Äôs do the same thing here. Our section, let‚Äôs select our section, that has fifteen, so with UX design selected let‚Äôs choose fifteen. Maybe that project main image is way too high. Let‚Äôs do one fifty. And that space underneath each of these project info blocks maybe a little higher. Let&#x27;s do twenty or even thirty. Maybe a little spacing reduction underneath the client, five pixels. And it might be worth considering changing this parent. Let‚Äôs select our grid, and remove the second column. So now it&#x27;s stacking, we have a top bottom design. And in that case, we might want to remove this margin even further. Let‚Äôs do fifteen pixels. So we can see the client, the project type, and then start reading about it. Now, somethings happening here that&#x27;s causing this to overflow. And we‚Äôll get to why in just a second. That‚Äôs down there. But ignoring that for now, lets test responsiveness here. This is getting a little tight on the images. Let‚Äôs choose again, this is one of those pesky image fives, let‚Äôs rename that. Let‚Äôs say project grid image, and set it‚Äôs height to maybe one fifty? We can even reduce this grid, let‚Äôs edit our grid, let‚Äôs reduce this to, let‚Äôs hold down Shift to adjust all sides at once, fifteen pixels. Press done. And now we have this problem right here. There‚Äôs a couple things going on, but a quick way to solve this we realize that a side by side is probably not going to work on mobile. Let‚Äôs edit our grid, and remove two of our columns. So now we have a stacked design. That‚Äôs going to solve the problem, which was caused by text overflowing, but let‚Äôs reduce some of these to not take up as much vertical height on Mobile landscape. Let‚Äôs do one hundred pixels, and maybe one hundred fifty pixels. And reduce this Div blocks padding to fifteen. Let‚Äôs actually rename that Other Projects Label. Lets test fluidity. That looks pretty good. Scroll down. We‚Äôve already tested these on other pages, but let‚Äôs just make sure it works fine here. That looks pretty good. So, one thing we‚Äôre noticing up here this would actually affect all pages, if we go back home on Mobile landscape Megan Garcia Portfolio, that might not be spaced correctly. Let‚Äôs double-click and see why that‚Äôs happening. So the brand bar right here has ten pixels of padding on the left. On Mobile landscape, which is what we‚Äôre editing now, we might want it to align. Let‚Äôs check Tablet real quick. Yeah it&#x27;s working fine there, but over here lets remove that padding on the left side. And because we changed it here, remember all instances of the Symbol look to the Symbol itself, which affects all pages. So back on project pages, that looks aligned. That looks much better.¬†</p><p>Let‚Äôs check out Mobile portrait. Everythings looking responsive here. It‚Äôs getting a little bit tight with these images but not too bad. Let‚Äôs check it on an iPhone 12 Pro Max. Let‚Äôs check it on iPhone 12, and 12 Pro. It‚Äôs looking fairly consistent. Let‚Äôs reduce the height of these images a little bit more to preserve that real estate. One twenty. Maybe decrease the size of the smaller heading to eighteen. The project info to maybe twelve. Let‚Äôs change the height. That looks pretty good. Something we‚Äôre noticing here, on the link block, it‚Äôs kind of small. And there‚Äôs not much real estate. Not much space to tap on the link block when you‚Äôre on mobile. And if we go to Tablet, this might not be big enough. In fact, this is a great type of change we might want to go all the way back to Desktop and make. Add some padding on the top and bottom, that increases the tap target, the target size here, so when someones clicking it they have a much wider area, a much better chance of hitting the target when they attempt to click, or especially when they attempt to go down to mobile devices or touch devices, they have that tap area that tap target that&#x27;s larger and more accessible. Also, let‚Äôs name it. Project Link. Back to Mobile portrait. It‚Äôs looking a lot better.¬†</p><p>Now, before we wrap up let‚Äôs move on to our last breakpoint, the larger breakpoint. Nineteen twenty. So, what‚Äôs happening here is you see it‚Äôs nineteen twenty pixels, that‚Äôs the viewport width. What‚Äôs happening here, is it‚Äôs scaling down. We‚Äôre seeing nineteen twenty pixels, and to do that, we‚Äôve scaled all the elements on the canvas down their original size. And, if we grab the edge here, and we continue dragging outwards, we can preview what this would look like on a much, much, much, much larger display. At any time, we can click in, of course, reset back to the original scaling, so that we can see the nineteen twenty breakpoint on this display. And things look pretty good here. Things look good on this display. Remember, earlier in the project we went over to the container and set it to sixteen hundred pixels, so our default container right here, on Desktop is twelve hundred pixel width. And when we go over here, it goes to sixteen hundred for a wider display. This might work fine. We can always make changes like on the project side by side, we can go in and decrease this, maybe give it a little more width over where. That could work. And, since these are scaled with a maximum height as well, they were at two eighty-seven before, we might want to hold down Option and make these a little bit taller since we have all of this extra real estate. Let‚Äôs do five hundred pixels. That looks pretty good. So, whenever we‚Äôre looking on any of these breakpoints, whether it&#x27;s nineteen twenty, Desktop, Tablet, whenever we‚Äôre looking at these, it‚Äôs really helpful to hold down Shift, Option, or Shift and Alt, and use left and right arrows to preview what each of these looks like. And they look pretty good now on the larger breakpoint. But that&#x27;s our larger breakpoint, nineteen twenty pixels.</p><p>But this is the last part of the project page. Now it responds well on Desktop, Tablet, Mobile landscape, Mobile portrait, and even NES. It also works really well on larger displays. Remember: you can clone this stage of the project to go in and see exactly how we built this, but for now, that&#x27;s creating CMS-driven project pages in our portfolio.</p><p>[Grimur] I‚Äôm feeling much more responsive, uh, thanks to this lesson.

And we&#x27;ll ensure that footer stays on the bottom of the page.</p></div><div class="transcript-overflow"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>We&#x27;ve built out a solid homepage. We built up portfolio pages and now we&#x27;ll do the last of our main pages, our contact page. Now, why are we doing this? We want to make it exceedingly simple for someone to reach out and get in touch. We have the contact form on the homepage. We have it on the project pages, but anytime someone clicks in the navbar, we want to take them to this page. It&#x27;ll be the same form, but on its own static page. And we&#x27;ll set it up with two things. The hero section, which includes the form and we&#x27;ll add our navbar and our footer, but we&#x27;ll use this to demonstrate how to make the footer stick to the bottom of shorter pages like this.</p><p>Let&#x27;s start with the hero section and before we go anywhere, always make sure you&#x27;re starting your design from the base breakpoint. If you&#x27;re in one of the larger breakpoints or one of the smaller breakpoints, and you start styling, adding elements and styling, remember, things start at the base breakpoint and they cascade down towards smaller devices and upwards towards larger devices. So we&#x27;re in our base breakpoint. Let&#x27;s go ahead and create that contact page. We&#x27;ll go to pages, add a new page. We&#x27;ll call this contact.</p><p>And our hero section is going to have two elements. There&#x27;s going to be a heading and then the contact form itself. Let&#x27;s add our heading. But first of course, we&#x27;ll add our section element. Section class. Let&#x27;s add a container, Command K for quick find, container. Let&#x27;s add our class, Command enter, type in container, press enter, and let&#x27;s add a heading, Command K, heading. And we can use any text we want, we can always change this later. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;d love to hear from you! That&#x27;s one element down, let&#x27;s add the contact form. Hit escape to de-select, Command K, contact form. Grab that Symbol.</p><p>Now, let&#x27;s configure the styling for our heading. We have some existing heading styles we can use as a starting point, but we&#x27;ll do something a little more custom here to match [inaudible 00:02:00]&#x27;s design. Let&#x27;s duplicate and say larger heading. And we&#x27;ll change that accordingly. Let&#x27;s make the size something closer to 48. That looks good. Change the line height one hyphen. And right now it&#x27;s maxed at 450 from the homepage. Let&#x27;s remove that. Let&#x27;s reset that maximum width. That looks pretty good. If we check our design in Figma, we&#x27;re using a specific color here. Let&#x27;s change that color to CBB8FF, which rhymes with nothing at all, and we&#x27;ll press return. And the color has been applied. Let&#x27;s add that as a secondary brand color, create. That way we can reuse that swatch elsewhere in our project. And that&#x27;s the hero section.</p><p>Let&#x27;s move on to our navbar and footer. Let&#x27;s add those two Symbols. So let&#x27;s go over to our Symbols panel. Let&#x27;s grab navigation and we&#x27;ll place it right in the page body, above this section. And we&#x27;ll go into the Symbols panel one more time and grab our footer. Footer of course not at the top. Let&#x27;s put it at the bottom outside of the section. And there it is.</p><p>Now, something to note with the footer. On this display right here, it looks fine. But if we go to a larger breakpoint, notice how it&#x27;s not at the bottom of the page. Maybe this is a design preference, but in most cases, we want the footer to stick to the bottom of the page. So how do we do that? Well first, so we can apply this to all our devices, let&#x27;s go back to the base breakpoint and we&#x27;ll select our body. And we&#x27;re going to go into our body, all pages tag, and we&#x27;re going to use flexbox to solve this. In fact, we&#x27;re going to make the entire body element flex, which press flexbox. This doesn&#x27;t look too good. Let&#x27;s make sure things are stacked vertically and things look the same right now.</p><p>In fact, if we click through, we go to the larger breakpoint. It looks the same as it did a moment ago, we can click through all of these. But what we unlocked here is the ability to stick our footer at the bottom. So let&#x27;s double click to edit our footer, to edit that Symbol. And we&#x27;ll set one thing top margin. We&#x27;ll just click into top margin, we&#x27;ll set the top margin to auto. Now we didn&#x27;t see any change here, but if you go back to the larger breakpoint, we can see it stuck to the bottom.</p><p>And here&#x27;s how that works. When a parent is set to flex and all its children are stacked, in this case, vertically, adding top margin auto will create automatic space above that element to fill up any available space inside that parent. For the body on this larger display, that means all the dead space that was below is no longer there because the footer has been pushed down. It created automatic margin above the footer. We can even click the edge of the canvas and increase the canvas width to some obscenely high number, and we can see the footer stays at the bottom of the page. Again, back to our base breakpoint, that&#x27;s looking pretty good.</p><p>And that&#x27;s really it. That&#x27;s a static contact page. We made our hero section and we added the navbar and footer Symbols. And we made sure that the footer sticks to the bottom of shorter pages.</p><p>Up next, we&#x27;ll very quickly check responsiveness and fluidity on all different breakpoints, and we&#x27;ll add recapture validation to reduce the amount of spam that our fictional UX designer, named Megan, receives.</p><p>Speaking of validation, I get extraordinary validation from people talking about me on Twitchster. I don&#x27;t mean to brag, but I&#x27;ve had three mentions already in the last 41 months. And I&#x27;m hoping to use this platform to increase the size of my following.

So in reality, yes, we are making incredible progress, but there&#x27;s still a lot to consider as we move forward.<br/>This lesson&#x27;s going to focus on reCAPTCHA validation, to reduce spam in our contact forms, and it&#x27;s going to cover responsiveness across all breakpoints, desktop, tablet, mobile landscape, mobile portrait, and the outdoor theater in Bryant Park. So reCAPTCHA, Google&#x27;s CAPTCHA, completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart. In other words, it trips up robots in an attempt to reduce spam. How do we add it? Well, we can just add a reCAPTCHA element anywhere inside our form block. So let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;re on the base break point and we&#x27;ll double click to edit our contact form. Remember, we&#x27;re editing a symbol here. That means changes here will affect every contact form everywhere. So we&#x27;re editing the symbol. Let&#x27;s go ahead into our ad panel and we&#x27;re going to add reCAPTCHA from here. Under forms, we have reCAPTCHA. Let&#x27;s use the navigator to place this precisely. We&#x27;ll put it inside the form and we&#x27;ll put it in between the message area and the submit button.<br/>[Sara] That&#x27;s it?<br/>[McGuire] What&#x27;s up?<br/>[Sara] Normally you talk more.<br/>[McGuire] Did you want us to talk more?<br/>[Sara] Yeah. How was your day?<br/>[McGuire] Good.<br/>[Sara] Okay.<br/>[McGuire] Let&#x27;s continue setting up our reCAPTCHA validation and we&#x27;ll go to our project settings to do that. So, project settings. Let&#x27;s head over to forms and we&#x27;ll want to scroll down to reCAPTCHA validation. There&#x27;s two things here, a site key and a secret key. Let&#x27;s go and register for a new key. Now we&#x27;re going to ignore this existing data on this test account. Instead, we&#x27;re going to press the plus button. This will create reCAPTCHA for a new site. So that site, let&#x27;s add one right here. Megan Garcia portfolio. This element integrates using reCAPTCHA V2. So we&#x27;ll use reCAPTCHA V2. We&#x27;re going to make sure the I&#x27;m not a robot checkbox is checked, to reduce the number of robots checking this box, and we&#x27;re going to add two domains, two domains right here. The first one we&#x27;ll add is Garciaux.com, press return.<br/>And the second one we want to add is our staging domain. So let&#x27;s go back to Webflow and we&#x27;ll go back to our general settings. This is where we can either copy this one, this sub domain, right to our clipboard, or we can change it, if now is the time we want to change our subdomain. We&#x27;re going to keep it like this, megangarciaportfolio.webflow.io. We&#x27;ll go to reCAPTCHA, paste that in, .webflow.io. And the reason we&#x27;re doing both of these domains is to ensure later when we publish our site on Megan&#x27;s custom.com domain, it works there and we want it to in the meantime, and anytime we&#x27;re on the staging domain, we want it to work on the staging domain too, so we can accurately test our reCAPTCHA element. Hit return, and both have been added.<br/>We&#x27;re going to accept the reCAPTCHA terms of service, send alerts to owners. We&#x27;re going to keep that on, so we get notifications if not working properly, then we&#x27;ll press submit. That&#x27;s a coincidence, a site key, and a secret key. We&#x27;ve seen this before. So let&#x27;s go, copy our site key, and we&#x27;ll go back to Megan Garcia portfolio. We&#x27;ll go back to forms and we&#x27;re going to go down here and paste in the site key, just pasting in what we copied to our clipboard. Back to reCAPTCHA. Copy the secret key back to the portfolio. Paste the secret key.<br/>The final thing we want to do is enable reCAPTCHA. Now, when this is enabled, all forms will be validated, all forms throughout the project. Forms that do not contain a reCAPTCHA field will fail to submit. Let&#x27;s save our changes and very carefully read this dialogue box, which is clearly stating that we have to make sure all our forms include the reCAPTCHA component before we enable this, as they&#x27;ll fail to submit, unless we have the reCAPTCHA element properly added to each form. Again, if you&#x27;re adding this to an existing site, this change will go into effect immediately before the next publish. Let&#x27;s enable reCAPTCHA and let&#x27;s scroll up to go back to the designer.<br/>But that&#x27;s setting up reCAPTCHA. Let&#x27;s move on to test responsiveness on this page. So we&#x27;re back on the contact page. We have our reCAPTCHA element. Again, this is located in reCAPTCHA and we&#x27;re on desktop. We&#x27;re on our base breakpoint. We may want to make an adjustment to the reCAPTCHA element so we can add margin on the top, just to push it off from the next element. Maybe 10 pixels on top. We&#x27;re just eyeballing it right now.<br/>Let&#x27;s press back to instance, so we&#x27;re no longer editing that symbol and let&#x27;s test responsiveness and fluidity. So if we grab the boundary, if we grab the edges of the viewport, let&#x27;s click and drag and test how this is working. So far, reCAPTCHA is working fine. The rest of the form looks good. We&#x27;ve done this before, but we&#x27;re checking what this static page looks like. Everything looks good on desktop. Let&#x27;s move on to tablet. Again, same thing. We&#x27;re going to test responsiveness and fluidity. The heading still seems to fit. The H1 still seems to fit. One thing to note, and we&#x27;re going to do a design review later to catch things like this, but it might be worth noting that if we go back here, this is an H1.<br/>And even if we go back to our homepage, this is an H one. Each of our secondary sections starts with an H2. This is a little more specific. So this is an H3, but if we go down to our contact form, when we click in here, it&#x27;s still an H1. We might want to go into the cog and make this an H2, a heading two, so that hierarchically our pages make a little more sense. In fact, if we leave this, if we stop editing the symbol, we know that change carried through to the contact page. So now we have a proper H1, I&#x27;d love to hear from you. And if we double click in here, we have the H2. Let&#x27;s work together. Of course, changes to headings like that affect all breakpoints. So let&#x27;s go back in. We&#x27;re in tablet. And of course it&#x27;s an H2 there as well. So we&#x27;re looking pretty good.<br/>Let&#x27;s move on to mobile landscape. Now you&#x27;ll notice the moment we switched between tablet and mobile landscape, this heading gets smaller. Remember we created a larger head in class as a duplicate. We duplicated the head in class and went back when we were in base break point. When we created this in the last lesson, and we changed a lot of this. We changed specifically the size, the height, the color, but when we duplicated that class, it brought with it other changes. So it brought back the changes on mobile landscape. So those are size and height differences. Maybe we want to increase this, hold down option and drag. Maybe that looks a little bit better, but keep in mind if we test fluidity, it knocks that to the next line. Maybe not so great. Let&#x27;s reduce it. 36 looks pretty good.<br/>As for the rest of it, everything&#x27;s wrapped in our container class and we know our container class is already configured on each breakpoint, so that looks pretty good. Again, testing that fluidity, looks great. Noticing now that our footer could go through one change, we could always catch this later, but let&#x27;s grab our text blocks here. Let&#x27;s grab our collection item or the collection list itself, and let&#x27;s set its children to center. That looks a little bit more balanced. We can always make changes to this later. Escape so that we&#x27;re no longer editing the footer.<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s go to mobile portrait. Now on mobile portrait, it&#x27;s a disaster. Why? Well, because the reCAPTCHA validation is hanging off the edge, and the reCAPTCHA element itself needs a little customization to make this work on a much more narrow viewport. So we&#x27;re going to do that right now. First, let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;re inside the form block. We&#x27;ve double clicked to edit our symbol, and we&#x27;re going to wrap our recapture element with a Div block. So let&#x27;s click the reCAPTCHA. Let&#x27;s do command K to enter quick find let&#x27;s do Div block. Press return. And we&#x27;ll just drag our reCAPTCHA element inside a Div block. With the Div block selected, let&#x27;s go over to our style panel and add a class. We&#x27;ll call it reCAPTCHA wrapper.<br/>And if we go down, we can actually transform the size. We can transform all of it. Let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;re actually locking to the top left. We&#x27;ll set our transform origin. So it anchors on the top left. And what that means is this. When we go and add our transform, let&#x27;s scale it. The scaling will occur around the top left of the element. Now it looks super tiny on the screen, but this is scaled at 0.7 and we can test what it looks like on different device widths. In fact, let&#x27;s go and grab this. Let&#x27;s see what it looks like on an iPhone. There&#x27;s the iPhone 12, 12 pro even on narrow devices, it looks okay. The only device, it hangs off the edge with still, is going to be the Nintendo entertainment system, which yes, that&#x27;s accurate.<br/>However, one thing to note on our contact form on all pages here, is this amount of padding on the sides might be a little much on mobile portrait. So with our form blocks selected, let&#x27;s go back up to padding. Let&#x27;s see what would happen if we reduce this maybe to 15 pixels on each side, or even because of our limited screen real estate, let&#x27;s do 10 pixels on all sides. It looks a lot better. Okay. And as the final step, let&#x27;s go back to our large breakpoint 1920. Let&#x27;s go back to our instance, so we&#x27;re no longer editing the contact form and this looks pretty good. Maybe the larger heading could be even larger. It has a maximum width. Let&#x27;s actually remove that maximum width here and set the size to 335.<br/>[Sara] (laughs) Stop doing that.<br/>[McGuire] But that&#x27;s it for now. We secured our contact form to reduce the chances of spam messages reaching our fictional UX designer. We also made sure it responded and was fluid on all device breakpoints, including desktop, tablet, mobile landscape, mobile portrait, and larger than 1920 pixel breakpoint.<br/>Up next in the course, we&#x27;ll set up and optimize our search settings, how people will find Megan&#x27;s portfolio site on search engines like Google.<br/>[Gr√≠mur] I received some pretty... How do you say? Interesting messages on Twitter, Pinstagram and LikedIn, and I want to thank everyone for sharing their progress. It keeps me going, almost as much as these Duracell brand batteries.<br/>[McGuire] Those are Energizer.<br/>[Gr√≠mur] No, it&#x27;s Duracell. I can see it. I see what I want to see.</p></div></nav></div></div><a href="/lesson/contact-page-responsiveness-recaptcha" class="button cc-primary cc-margin-top w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a><div class="button-container"><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Download assets</div></a></div><div class="button-wrapper margin"><a href="https://webflow.com/website/portfoliocourse-contact-responsiveness" target="_blank" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block"><div>Clone this project</div></a></div><a href="#" class="button cc-primary w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a></div></div><div class="w-embed"><div style="display: none;" data-lesson-video-url="https://youtu.be/TC0ovgosjkc"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-2 lesson-content w-dyn-item"><div class="flex_vertical_left"><h2 class="h3 w-dyn-bind-empty"></h2><div class="rich_light w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="transcript-overflow w-condition-invisible"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></nav></div></div><a href="/lesson/section-heading-site-settings" class="button cc-primary cc-margin-top w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a><div class="button-container"><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Download assets</div></a></div><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Clone this project</div></a></div><a href="#" class="button cc-primary w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a></div></div><div class="w-embed"><div style="display: none;" data-lesson-video-url=""></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-2 lesson-content w-dyn-item"><div class="flex_vertical_left"><h2 class="h3">SEO &amp; Open graph settings</h2><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>This lesson covers setting static and dynamic SEO titles and meta descriptions, as well as configuring Open Graph settings which will show up in embedded links in services like Twitter.</p></div><div class="transcript-overflow"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>Three main pages, technically more because our projects designed automatically created a page for each project and were looking pretty good. In this lesson. We&#x27;re going to cover our SEO titles and meta descriptions, and we&#x27;ll cover Open Graph settings. We&#x27;ll even cover how to dynamically configure titles and descriptions based on our CMS content. We&#x27;ll do this for each page type, our homepage, our project pages and our contact page.</p><p>Let&#x27;s start with the first page. This is not the right page, let&#x27;s go back to our homepage. Now it doesn&#x27;t matter for SEO settings how we do this, it doesn&#x27;t matter what break point we&#x27;re on but we&#x27;re going to switch to the base break point just in case we make any other changes. And from the pages panel at any time we can go and click the cog, edit page settings. Now the page name here, where it says home, this is internal only, this is for us organizing our static and dynamic pages. So let&#x27;s keep page name home for right now and we&#x27;ll go right into SEO settings, title tag. Now we can always come back to this later, but for now, let&#x27;s move on and do the meta description. So this is what shows up usually in the preview underneath the title. Let&#x27;s paste, what we have on our clipboard of course you can configure this to whatever works best for your portfolio. And we&#x27;ll do the same for Open Graph.</p><p>Now there&#x27;s a couple of options here. We can check same as SEO tag, it&#x27;ll just import the information from here and keep that current. So if we make a change here like that, that&#x27;ll show up in our Open Graph title. Or we can uncheck and do something custom. It could say meet Megan Garcia, UX Designer extraordinaire. We&#x27;ll pull the same SEO meta description and now we get to add our Open Graph image URL, this is usually what displays if for instance you share something on Twitter. Now later on, we can customize this, there&#x27;s some guidance here to help configure your image, but let&#x27;s hit save and actually grab something from our assets panel. For this, let&#x27;s grab our hero image and we&#x27;ll just copy that asset to our clipboard. Close out of here, back to our pages panel, back to our cog and let&#x27;s paste in that URL. So this is our Open Graph preview. Let&#x27;s save our changes. That&#x27;s one page down, let&#x27;s move on to the second page.</p><p>Now we can stay on the homepage here, what&#x27;s over here does not matter when we&#x27;re editing our SEO settings or are Open Graph settings. Let&#x27;s edit our page settings for our projects template. Same basic principle here, but now we&#x27;re able to use dynamic data. Now we can use Megan Garcia, UX Designer, anywhere we want, but if we want before that, we can add a field. So let&#x27;s add some space here and we&#x27;ll go to add field. And we can pull in anything from this collection, from our projects template. So maybe the project type, so we have UX design here. In fact, we might want to structure it so it starts with the project title. Let&#x27;s go in and add a field, let&#x27;s choose the client name and we&#x27;ll do UX design Megan Garcia, or we can even do by Megan Garcia. This way, if we flip through here we can just use this to swap through Hillside Calm. Now it says web design by Megan Garcia. So Hillside Calm is pulling from the client name, project type is web design, they all say by Megan Garcia, let&#x27;s check the third one prototyping by making Garcia. What we&#x27;re doing is we&#x27;re dynamically placing together these variables and creating a title that will display on search engines based on that.</p><p>Take it even further with our meta description. I had the pleasure of working with, client name on a project type project in project year. Or we can take an entirely different approach. Learn about my work or learn about my project type work, let&#x27;s do project type work, with, and let&#x27;s do the client name period. Then we can actually add the full description, we can go to the brief project description. This way in our search result preview we&#x27;re getting all of that information, it&#x27;s dynamic, it&#x27;s pulling in the description in addition to what project type was done for which client. That looks pretty good.</p><p>Open Graph settings, same thing here we can add fields or we can just grab, maybe for this we want to grab the same information from our SEO title tag. And maybe for this, we just want the description. Let&#x27;s go to add field, let&#x27;s grab the brief project description and maybe add learn more on my online portfolio. And there&#x27;s one more trick here, we can pull that project image, the main project image in dynamically. So from here let&#x27;s select project image and just like that it&#x27;s pulling in, into the Open Graph preview, it&#x27;s pulling in that image from each project. Dynamically generated SEO settings and Open Graph settings. Let&#x27;s save our project&#x27;s template settings and we&#x27;ll move on to our third page.</p><p>This is the contact page and this will be pretty straightforward. Let&#x27;s go and do edit page settings. Get in touch, Megan Garcia, UX Designer. Meta description, if you&#x27;re looking for a UX designer to change your life, please reach out. I aim to respond within one business day. And Open Graph we&#x27;re going to keep the same SEO title tag and the same meta description. For the Open Graph image URL let&#x27;s grab that same image from our clipboard earlier, we&#x27;ll paste that into here and we have a get in touch page that&#x27;ll be shared for Open Graph compatible sites. Let&#x27;s save.</p><p>But those are the basics we covered each page. We added our SEO titles and our meta descriptions to our homepage, we did it dynamically on our project pages and we did it on our contact page. Gr√≠mur.</p><p>[Gr√≠mur] Got a great challenge for today.

And the whole concept here is based on two things, a trigger and an animation. When we do this, animate that. And we can set up all kinds of triggers, hover, follow the mouse, scroll, click, and we&#x27;ll use different triggers on each of these three. We&#x27;ll build a timed animation. When the page loads we&#x27;ll have this animation, we&#x27;ll build a continuous animation. It&#x27;s always looking for our scroll position and moving the cards in the Hero section based on our scroll. And finally, we&#x27;ll do this glow effect on each of our project cards. Let&#x27;s start with the first one. Now we have an image element. This is our Hero image for right now, we&#x27;re going to replace it and we&#x27;ll use a Div block to do that. Let&#x27;s go in and drag a Div block into our Hero section.</p><p>We&#x27;ll do it inside the section, but outside the container, not inside the container. We&#x27;ll put it right above the image. And we&#x27;ll set the height right now using pixels. Let&#x27;s set the minimum height or let&#x27;s set the height to 500px. That looks okay. Now we have this Hero image, this existing JPEG. Instead, we&#x27;re going to drag in six individual items. And the reason we&#x27;re doing that is because we want to set up an interaction on each individual element. We want to play with individual elements. So our Div block with it selected let&#x27;s Ctrl+K, and let&#x27;s enter a grid. Now we have a grid sitting inside that Div block. We&#x27;re going to do three columns and two rows just as we see here, the reason we have three columns and two rows is we&#x27;re recreating that image underneath. Let&#x27;s click out. So we&#x27;re done editing the grid and we&#x27;re just going to follow this order.</p><p>So let&#x27;s go into our assets and we&#x27;re just going to drag each image in following the same order we used before. Third image, then we have photography. This is our fourth image. Fifth image. And for our final image, we have that building this project. Drag it into the last cell. And to sort of match the spacing, let&#x27;s select our grid. Let&#x27;s of course call this grid Hero images. Let&#x27;s edit our grid and we&#x27;ll increase the spacing. Hold down Shift and we&#x27;ll drag to create, let&#x27;s say 40px matches pretty closely to the visual there. Let&#x27;s press done. Now it&#x27;s up to us, whether we want to add that black background. If we want to with Hero images selected, we can go down and add a black background, or we can do a light gray.</p><p>For now, let&#x27;s remove the background color so we go to the default transparent. And the next thing we want to do is select our images and add a class. We&#x27;re doing this so we can make changes to all the images at the same time. Let&#x27;s call this Hero image. This might be a little confusing. Let&#x27;s rename Hero images to Hero image grid, and then we&#x27;ll go in and apply Hero image to each of these. Ctrl+Enter Hero image. We can use the left and right keys to select between sibling elements. So we&#x27;re just going to press right Ctrl+Enter Hero image, press right, Ctrl+Enter Hero image. Last one, Ctrl+Enter Hero image.</p><p>So now they have the same class applied and we might want that in the future because it might make sense to add a box shadow to it to visually differentiate between the image and the background. Let&#x27;s drop this way down. That looks okay for now. We can always come back and change this later. So what have we built so far? A few different things. First off, let&#x27;s select our original image or Hero image, and let&#x27;s hide this for now. We&#x27;ll call this original Hero image and we&#x27;re going to set this display to display none. So it doesn&#x27;t render on the page. So this is our current Hero section, not bad. What does it look like when we preview?</p><p>Let&#x27;s grab the edge. It&#x27;s responsive by default. It&#x27;s not the most impressive thing ever made. Let&#x27;s go out of preview and let&#x27;s build our interaction. Let&#x27;s grab our canvas and widen that. And we&#x27;ll set our original Hero image back to block so we can see what&#x27;s going on. It&#x27;s okay that these things are overflowing right now. They&#x27;re hidden by our Hero image because we&#x27;re about to add our interaction on the grid. So a couple of things here. An interaction is split into two categories. There&#x27;s triggers again, there&#x27;s a trigger and an animation. When this happens, then this happens. There are two types of triggers. There&#x27;s an element trigger when someone clicks on an element, they hover over an element, they mouse over an element, they scroll into view when that element scrolls into view. And of course, while that element is scrolling with the view, but those are triggers on the element. What about on the page?</p><p>Well, page triggers happen when the mouse is moving in the entire viewport or when the page is scrolling, when the page loads, when the page is scrolled. We&#x27;re going to use a page load transition here. So let&#x27;s click that. When the page loads, there are two options. When the page starts loading, we can do something and when the page finishes loading. We&#x27;ll choose when the page finishes loading and let&#x27;s start an animation. So when the page finishes loading, we want to start an animation and we&#x27;re going to make a new one. We have none in our current project. So we&#x27;re going to make a new animation. Let&#x27;s call this Hero page load. And what do we want?</p><p>Well, we&#x27;re using this as reference. So we&#x27;ll get rid of this Hero image in a moment. But for right now, we want when the page loads, we want let&#x27;s say to move this. And what that means is this, if we add a move, let&#x27;s say we move to the left, say 500px to the left. If we hit play, when the page loads, it&#x27;s going to move from its starting position 500px left. Not the most impressive thing ever, but we can do more. Instead of moving at 500px, let&#x27;s actually remove that. In fact, let&#x27;s remove, let&#x27;s delete that action altogether. Instead, we&#x27;re going to do a rotate and on page load, we&#x27;re going to rotate this. So it looks similar to what we see underneath. Say about nine degrees, 9.5 degrees matches pretty nicely.</p><p>So right now it&#x27;s not too impressive. We hit play, it does that, but there&#x27;s a couple of things we can do to make this better. Let&#x27;s save our interaction for right now. And we&#x27;ll go back to the Style panel because we have this Div block, the parent, and we&#x27;re going to turn this Div block into a camera. And we&#x27;re going to rename the Div block, camera or Hero camera. And all we&#x27;re going to do to turn this into a camera is enable children perspective. Under 2D and 3D transforms, we&#x27;re going to click the three dots to access transform settings. Then we&#x27;re going to add a children perspective. We&#x27;ll choose 1000px by default. The lower this number is the more dramatic. The 3D perspective is going to look. The higher the number is the more flat than isometric the look is going to be. So 1000, a nice middle ground.</p><p>Let&#x27;s go back to our interaction. And on page load, we have this, we created this timed animation, let&#x27;s go back in. Again, If we hit play now, not too impressive, but let&#x27;s add a tilt. So we&#x27;re going to click this action. This action so far includes rotating about the z-axis. Let&#x27;s rotate about the x-axis as well. Here we have a slight tilt effect. Hit play. Little more impressive, still not perfect. So let&#x27;s change our ease in from linear to ease in out, hit play. We&#x27;re getting somewhere. Let&#x27;s slow this down to say five seconds. That&#x27;s looking a lot nicer. Let&#x27;s save for the moment. And we&#x27;ll go back to our Style panel.</p><p>Because right now our Hero camera, if we go to preview mode, we can see these images are sort of leaking out. They&#x27;re overflowing on the bottom and we can&#x27;t see it, but they might be overflowing on the top. Here&#x27;s what to do with that camera. Let&#x27;s select our Hero camera. Then we&#x27;ll go and set overflow to hidden. That&#x27;ll chop off anything that extends outside beyond the boundaries of the Hero camera. And let&#x27;s select our Hero image or original Hero image and set it to display none. So here&#x27;s our Hero section right now. Let&#x27;s go into preview mode. And just like that, we&#x27;ve created a pretty impressive, basic interaction. So how do we make it better?</p><p>Well, we can stack multiple actions in an interaction. So let&#x27;s go back to interactions. We&#x27;re going to open up page load. Let&#x27;s open up our Hero page load, our timed animation we just made. And let&#x27;s add a second one. Now, before we add any timed interaction, the element we want moving or rotating or changing opacity. When we want to add an animation on something, we have to select the item. We have to select the element that we want to change. So right now we can&#x27;t actually add an action. You have to select an element to enable more actions. So let&#x27;s do that. Let&#x27;s select our Hero image grid. We know right now, over five seconds, it rotates 26 degrees about the x-axis and 9.5 degrees about the z-axis. Let&#x27;s do more. Let&#x27;s add an opacity interaction. So we can change opacity. So right now it&#x27;s by default 100%. We could it go invisible as it rotates. Again, by default it&#x27;s over 0.5 seconds. Let&#x27;s change that to five seconds as well and press play.</p><p>The end result is empty. Let&#x27;s fix that. Let&#x27;s reverse this. So if we want to start at 100%, let&#x27;s create an action. Above here, if we actually go above the zero seconds frame, there&#x27;s this little spot up here we can press and do opacity. And what this is doing is it&#x27;s pushing down everything else. It pushed down the other actions. And we can actually toggle with this little switch here called set as initial state. What initial state does is exactly that it sets the initial opacity. In this case, opacity because we have the opacity action added. Let&#x27;s turn that on. Then we can say, we want the initial state to be 0%. So it&#x27;s going to be completely transparent when it first loads. Then at zero seconds, it&#x27;s going to start an animation in which it rotates. We know that over five seconds, the same thing&#x27;s going to happen with our second action. We&#x27;ll increase that opacity to 100%. So let&#x27;s recap. What do we expect when we press play?</p><p>We know it&#x27;s going to start at 0% opacity, and then it&#x27;s going to rotate and transition to 100% opacity. Both of these happen over five seconds. So let&#x27;s press play. And it&#x27;s performing exactly as we&#x27;d expect. If we go into preview mode, we can see our interaction even as we resize. We can see that interaction play out right on the canvas. Now, what does this look like on smaller devices?</p><p>So let&#x27;s check Tablet. Let&#x27;s press play. It looks okay here, but the problem is we&#x27;ve set a height on this Hero camera of 500px. Let&#x27;s go back and change that height on Tablet, maybe 300px. Let&#x27;s try that out in preview mode. That looks a lot better. Let&#x27;s check responsiveness and fluidity. We&#x27;re switching here, of course, to Desktop. In fact, we may want to go back to Desktop and change that to let&#x27;s say 450, but another thing to note, and this is an advanced technique, is we can set the height of this camera, this Hero camera to be a function of the width of our viewport. So for instance, if we want our height to be set based on the width of this, we can use, let&#x27;s say 10vw, just as a starting point. That&#x27;s not enough. Let&#x27;s increase that. Let&#x27;s eyeball this maybe 30, 35vw.</p><p>Now, as we change the width, you can see these things responding proportionally. Again, that&#x27;s because the height is now a function of the width. On Tablet, we can actually remove this height. So it should scale proportionally there as well. We can take this even further. If we want to go back. Since this is a grid and our grid gaps are currently set on the Hero image grid, we can go in to edit that grid and we can change these boundaries, this gap, which is currently set to 41px. We can set it to let&#x27;s say 1vw on the column width. Let&#x27;s approximate that it looks like 3vw is pretty good. We can set the rows to also respect the width, 3vw. That&#x27;s pretty close. So it&#x27;ll keep the proportions even. So if we press done and we go to preview mode, we should be able to resize this. And it should scale proportionally through all of our breakpoints. And it does but that&#x27;s our first interaction. That&#x27;s our page load interaction.</p><p>Let&#x27;s take it even further with our next interaction. We&#x27;re going to do it on a lot of these same elements. So the interaction right now occurs inside the Hero camera. We rotate our Hero image grid. Again, it starts at 0% opacity and it rotates and comes up to 100% opacity over five seconds. We&#x27;re going to do something with the individual images. And we&#x27;ll do this in two sets. Now, each of these images, as you&#x27;ll remember has the same class applied, Hero image. We&#x27;re going to apply a slightly different class to the bottom one. So we&#x27;ll keep Hero image and we&#x27;ll add a combo class called bottom. And we&#x27;ll add that to each of these. Bottom as well here and finally to the third one bottom. And we&#x27;re doing this for a specific reason.</p><p>Let&#x27;s select any of our top images and we&#x27;ll go over to interactions and we&#x27;re going to add another one. This is also going to be a trigger on the page, but we&#x27;re going to add an interaction while the page is scrolling to press that. And when it&#x27;s scrolling on scroll, we&#x27;re going to perform an action. We&#x27;re going to play a scroll animation. And we have no scroll animations built in our project yet. So we&#x27;ll add a new one right here. And since this interaction occurs on the page, we get to select the element or the elements which respond to this animation. So with any of our top Hero images selected, we&#x27;re going to add a scroll action. We&#x27;re going to move this.</p><p>So as we scroll through the page, 0%, that means when we&#x27;re at the top of the page. 100%, that means we&#x27;re at the bottom of the page. Let&#x27;s demonstrate that. 0% let&#x27;s say we don&#x27;t want these moving at all. Let&#x27;s add the number zero. So the left and right, the x-axis we&#x27;re not going to move it to the left or the right. When is at the top of the page, we want its position to be zero. That&#x27;s right where we see it on page load by default. But if that&#x27;s 0%, what happens if we change the position at 100%? Well, at 100%, this Hero image, let&#x27;s try moving it to the left. So just left 97px. That&#x27;s okay for now. Actually let&#x27;s pull it up to 500px, even off the screen right now. Turn on live preview. And when we scroll, the image moves to the left. When we scroll back up, the image moves back to its original position.</p><p>In fact, if we preview we can see the animation still occurs, our timed animation. But notice how this top image is moving to the left as we scroll down. Let&#x27;s do it to more of them. Back at a preview or still in interactions notice how this affects the selected element. It says you&#x27;re now only affecting the selected element. Okay. Got it. Let&#x27;s change that to the class. Now, anything that has the Hero image class will be affected. Let&#x27;s go to preview mode, take a look at this. And as we scroll down, you can see everything&#x27;s moving to the left. Scroll back up, everything&#x27;s moving back. That looks okay for one of the rows. Let&#x27;s change the bottom row. And the way we&#x27;re doing this here, because we added this combo class, this Hero image bottom, let&#x27;s go back to interactions. We&#x27;ll use the page scroll, go to our scroll animation. By the way, now is a good time. Let&#x27;s name it Hero scroll animation. And with this one selected, with any of our bottom elements selected. Let&#x27;s add another 0% and another 100%. Let&#x27;s add a move.</p><p>Again, this one&#x27;s going to zero out. So when it starts, it&#x27;s not moving at all from its X position from its left right position. And at 100%, we&#x27;ll add one more. This will be a move. We want this one to move 500px to the right. Now it&#x27;s kind of buried underneath these two that&#x27;s okay, because we&#x27;re going to affect not the selected element, but the class. And that will affect Hero image bottom. Let&#x27;s go into preview. We can see the page load animation, but we can also scroll at any time and see our continuous animation. See our scroll based animation. Track our position on the page. Now, one more thing to think about. Let&#x27;s leave our preview mode and we&#x27;ll press save on our Hero scroll animation.</p><p>This is smoothing. Smoothing is damping. It&#x27;s controlling how quickly an animation catches up to our actual scroll position. So if we set this to 0%, let&#x27;s set it to zero. As we scroll, we can see that left and right motion, very aggressively following our scroll position. Without any delay, it&#x27;s following our scroll position on the page. But when we increase smoothing, let&#x27;s say, let&#x27;s bring this up to 85%. Let&#x27;s preview again. Notice just how when we scroll, if we do it slowly, it looks real time but as we actually scroll like this, you can see it&#x27;s delaying a little bit. In fact, let&#x27;s emphasize that more. Let&#x27;s switch it to 95% and we&#x27;ll go to preview.</p><p>We can see as we scroll, it takes a second to catch up. Why would we do that? Why would we choose something other than zero? Well, a lot of times we&#x27;ll use a scroll wheel on a mouse. And when we scroll up and down, you can still see that animation occur as opposed to if we go back and we change this to 0%, it might not be a noticeable animation when we scroll on a scroll wheel. It&#x27;s a little bit jumpy. So smoothing again, this increases the damping. 50% is the default. It might look good at 50%. Let&#x27;s leave that at 50. And as we use a scroll wheel, we can see that animation. Maybe soften it a little bit. Let&#x27;s do 80%. And now when we use a scroll wheel, that looks okay, we can see the animation. If we use the track pad, we can see it responds right as we scroll. It looks smooth. We&#x27;re getting that 3D tilt effect again because our section is a camera. Let&#x27;s check it on other breakpoints.</p><p>We&#x27;re scrolling down and see that rotation is a little more dramatic on a smaller breakpoint. Let&#x27;s go down to this one as we scroll. It&#x27;s pretty good. We can always use viewport units. We could use viewport units on the animation itself. If we wanted to control it a little more proportionally to the width of the viewport, back to the base breakpoint, toggle preview, we can see it comes in slowly over five seconds. A nice subtle interaction. And when we scroll, we have that subtle move on the top row to the left and the bottom row to the right. It&#x27;s very subtle, but sometimes the best interactions are. For instance, did you notice the pen that&#x27;s been hovering here for the entire lesson? It might look like a visual effect, but then could we interact with it?</p><p>Sometimes playing with someone&#x27;s expectation of an interaction is just as exhilarating or maybe just as effective as something that&#x27;s 100% in your face and obvious. In other words, are interactions there to add value and delight, or are they just there to flex a muscle that says, &quot;I know how to use interactions.&quot; Sometimes it&#x27;s both and that&#x27;s okay, but a little subtlety can go a long way.</p><p>Let&#x27;s move on to our final interaction. And for this one, we&#x27;re going to be effecting our selected projects. Again, this is on the homepage. And each of these selected projects as a refresher is made up of let&#x27;s rename some of these to keep organized. We have this collection list, let&#x27;s call this selected projects list. And we have a collection list wrapper that contains all of them. We&#x27;re going to be working inside of this collection list. In fact, we&#x27;ll be working on the image itself. Again, to keep things organized, let&#x27;s call this project image, selected projects image, and we&#x27;re going to duplicate it. Remember a change to any one collection item affects all the others. So let&#x27;s right click and duplicate this image. So now each of our collection items is made up of three parts of the grid.</p><p>We have the project details, the selected projects image, and the next selected projects image. Let&#x27;s remove the class because we&#x27;re going to do some new styling to this. So let&#x27;s remove. Let&#x27;s go and click remove class. So now there&#x27;s nothing on this image in terms of styling, it&#x27;s just sitting inside a grid. So let&#x27;s make sure it&#x27;s position is set to absolute. And right now it blows out of proportion. That&#x27;s okay. We&#x27;re going to fix that because an absolute child, a child element that&#x27;s set to absolute position, it&#x27;s looking up the hierarchy. So right now its parent is collection item. It&#x27;s looking for the first parent item it can find that set to anything other than static. In straightforward terms, that means we have to set its parent, its collection item to something other than static. Let&#x27;s set it to relative positioning.</p><p>And just like that, our image is spanning across all of this right now. We&#x27;re going to change it. First off let&#x27;s name it, let&#x27;s call it selected projects effect. And we&#x27;re going to do a few things here. First off, because we&#x27;ve enabled absolute positioning, we can set z-index to a negative value. Let&#x27;s do negative one. So now it&#x27;s behind that. But the other thing to note is that it&#x27;s also being sized in its original proportions. Let&#x27;s have it span the full proportions of this by setting its width to 100% and its height to 100%. So now it&#x27;s behind the selected projects. Now it&#x27;s behind each of these collection items. Why are we doing this?</p><p>Well, want to add a blurred shadow effect. So now with the selected projects effect selected, we can go back to filters. Let&#x27;s add a filter to blur. Then we can instantly see we have this blur effect behind it. Let&#x27;s set it to about 40px. Let&#x27;s also increase our saturation. We&#x27;re going to add a second filter to increase saturation. And 0% is black and white, 200% is really upping that saturation. And let&#x27;s add a transform to move this. Let&#x27;s move it down a little bit. So we have that glow effect a little bit underneath. Now, if we preview like this, we can see the effect. It&#x27;s behind each collection item. Let&#x27;s click out, we&#x27;re turning this into an interaction.</p><p>So we want to interact with the collection item itself. Let&#x27;s go to interactions, make sure our collection item is selected. And when we do this, this will be an element trigger. So when we hover over, when the mouse hovers over this element, when it hovers over the collection item, we want to start an action. Let&#x27;s start an animation. And we&#x27;re going to add a new one here. And this animation is going to have two different steps, two actions. It&#x27;ll have an initial state and it&#x27;ll have a hovered state. So let&#x27;s do both of those. Let&#x27;s create one.</p><p>Now, if we start styling, if we create an action right here and let&#x27;s say effect opacity, notice how it&#x27;s going to change the opacity of the entire element. We don&#x27;t want that. In fact, let&#x27;s delete that. Because this timed animation, which we can name, selected projects hover, because this timed animation affects the collection item, but we can animate any of these elements. Let&#x27;s widen this, we want to select our selected projects effect and we want to make sure its opacity is set to 0%. So let&#x27;s go down, change its opacity to 0%. Now we can&#x27;t see it. That&#x27;s what we want as the initial state, when the page loads. So let&#x27;s turn on set as initial state. But when we hover, we want to see that glow. So we&#x27;re going to add a new action where the opacity goes up to 100%. Again, if we wanted it at 50%, we could set it at 50. If we want it at 100%, 100%. Let&#x27;s set it at 100% for now. By default, it&#x27;s over 0.5 seconds. That&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s linear.</p><p>Let&#x27;s press play and see what that looks like. Maybe speed that up a little bit. Let&#x27;s say 0.2 seconds. That looks okay. Let&#x27;s add a nice ease. So that&#x27;ll be on hover. So if we go to the preview mode by default, it&#x27;s going to have 0% opacity. When we hover over, it will have 100%. Now, if we hover out, nothing happens. We&#x27;re going to fix that in a second, but let&#x27;s demonstrate that we can do this on the second one as well. Then of course, the third one, we get the picture. Let&#x27;s go out of preview mode, scroll back up because this is the one we&#x27;re effecting. Let&#x27;s press save because we need to add one more thing. On hover out, we want to start an animation. And in this case we have the selected projects hover. We have that already created. So let&#x27;s duplicate it and we can do that right here. We have selected projects hover two, let&#x27;s select that one. So on hover, we want the hover. On hover out we&#x27;re going to click this one. Let&#x27;s rename this selected projects out.</p><p>Now remember on the first one, we had two actions. It still has two actions because we duplicated it. We&#x27;ll delete the initial state. Let&#x27;s remove that one. We only have one action left. Again, 0.2 seconds it&#x27;ll ease. We&#x27;re going to take this down to zero because when we hover out, we want that glow to go down to zero. Let&#x27;s save our changes and let&#x27;s preview. So again, just as we expected, 0%, we can not see the glow when it&#x27;s not hovered. And when we hover into the boundary, we see the glow. What happens when we hover out? Glow disappears. Hover out, hover out. Trying it on the second one, hover out, hover out. Now has anyone else noticed, this is not a clickable link. We want, anytime someone clicks this left side, this view project side, we want it to be a clickable link that takes us to that selected project.</p><p>So let&#x27;s just go in and select our project details. This is a Div block and we can right click. To make it easy, we can right click on the label and we can press it convert to link block. Now we didn&#x27;t see any visible change, but we can always go into our element settings with that link block now selected. Then we can have it take website visitors to any page. In fact, we want it going to current project. That means when we go into preview mode and we press view project on anywhere inside this pane, it will take us to the architectural website. That&#x27;s exactly what we want. Let&#x27;s go out of preview mode. Let&#x27;s go back to home. And it&#x27;s behaving exactly as we expect.</p><p>Now, if we don&#x27;t want to see the hover when we&#x27;re previewing, we can always go in and select that selected projects effect. And we can go in on the Style panel and change its opacity to 0%. Remember we said in initial state, we set the interaction so we&#x27;ll override that when we go to preview, it&#x27;ll still be empty, hover, we can see it, hover out, we can&#x27;t. Sometimes hover effects are not what we&#x27;re looking for on Tablet or Mobile landscape or Mobile portrait. We can at any time, let&#x27;s go back to the base breakpoint. We can at any time go into that interaction. Let&#x27;s make sure our collection item is selected and we can go into that mouse hover and change. So maybe we only want it on Desktop and above. Let&#x27;s uncheck Tablet, phone landscape and phone portrait.</p><p>And now it&#x27;ll work on Desktop, but on Tablet, Mobile landscape or Mobile portrait but that&#x27;s it. Three different interactions, three different triggers that each result in a different kind of animation. We have our timed animation, which occurs on page load. We have our continuous animation where the position of the images shift as we scroll up and down the page. And we have our glow animation, which responds on mouse hover. Hover in and hover out. There&#x27;s a lot coming up. More interactions. And we&#x27;re about to shift into advanced mode as we&#x27;ll design or redesign huge parts of our site, including a branded 404 page, password page. We&#x27;ll do an accessibility audit, a design review with Sana, Google Analytics, and so much more. But first-</p><p>[Gr√≠mur] About a year ago, McGuire did a digital scan of my bus. Bus.

Before we do anything else, before we do any styling, let&#x27;s add all the correct elements. So we&#x27;re going to add a Div block. This is going to hold some other content on the page. This Div block we&#x27;re going to call frosted glass, which we&#x27;ll use later to create a frosted glass effect. Let&#x27;s add some stuff inside. Command K. Let&#x27;s do a text block. Inside this, we&#x27;re going to write the numbers 404. Not too profound-looking. We&#x27;ll fix that in a moment and make the text really, really large.</p><p>This text here is in a Div. That&#x27;s okay. We&#x27;re going to move it under 404 into the frosted glass again. Now our frosted glass contains a text block and some more text in the form of a Div block. The third thing we&#x27;re going to add, command K, is a button. Now we have a button. So a big heading, Page Not Found. This is an H2. Let&#x27;s make this an H1, since it&#x27;ll be the primary heading on the page. We have a separate Div block. This Div block, we called frosted glass. It has three things inside a text block, which says 404, another piece of text. It&#x27;s a Div block, but it could be any text, saying, &quot;The page you are looking for doesn&#x27;t exist or has been moved,&quot; and a button. We want this button to route us. We can say back to homepage, and when we do that, we can press the cog and have it take us back to our homepage.</p><p>That&#x27;s our first part. Let&#x27;s move onto the second part, which is styling. There&#x27;s a lot of things we can do to this. There are some defaults. Utility page content by default has a width of 260. We might want something wider. We can eyeball it, or we can just remove that width altogether so it&#x27;s sized by the content inside. Let&#x27;s change Page Not Found. Let&#x27;s start here first off, let&#x27;s do Page not found in sentence case, and we can choose. We have Enter here. Let&#x27;s choose a 400 weight. Something to note, this is the current lighter variant, but we could select our utility page rep. We&#x27;re affecting both utility pages. This will affect the 404 page and the password page.</p><p>Let&#x27;s try a darker background color here. So let&#x27;s set this to a dark color. In fact, to be precise, let&#x27;s do 17, 17, 18, and let&#x27;s set our text color to something lighter. Let&#x27;s do white. Let&#x27;s lower the opacity a little bit and then bring it back up a little bit. That looks pretty good. Let&#x27;s select our frosted glass, and for now, we&#x27;re going to add white. Then we&#x27;ll set a very transparent look. We&#x27;ll add some padding to add some space on all sides. Let&#x27;s do 30 pixels on all sides. We&#x27;ll set a maximum width on this frosted glass. Let&#x27;s set a maximum width of let&#x27;s say 320 pixels. For our 404, let&#x27;s increase that size. In fact, let&#x27;s first choose DM Serif Display. Set our line height to unit list. That&#x27;s 1-return, and let&#x27;s increase our font size to something very large.</p><p>Now, when styling something like this, this might not have been the best setup for us. In fact, we could instead set frosted glass. We could remove that maximum width and instead use the maximum width on our Div block here. In fact, let&#x27;s name this 404 details, and let&#x27;s set a maximum width here of 320. You&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s pulled over to the left. We could select frosted glass and just make sure to set it to flex box. Then we can vertically align everything to the center. It looks a lot better. Now it will be sized based on whatever&#x27;s taking up more space. So as we size our topography, everything works as it should, and we&#x27;ll land on 172. That looks pretty good for now.</p><p>Let&#x27;s rename this text block 404. That&#x27;s the 404. Let&#x27;s add a little margin at the bottom, push it off the bottom to space. Maybe 30 pixels. Let&#x27;s dial our homepage button and set the background color to black. It&#x27;s a block element by default, but we can set its width to 100%, and we can even add a divider. First let&#x27;s call this Utility button, and let&#x27;s add a divider between the 404 details and the utility button. Let&#x27;s press command K, Div block, and we can set its width by default. We can send its width to 100%. So now it&#x27;s taking up that width. Let&#x27;s set its height to one pixel, and let&#x27;s add some margin, just holding down Option or Alt to add margin on the top and bottom. Let&#x27;s do 30 pixels on the top and bottom.</p><p>So our divider right now is transparent. So if we press Escape, it&#x27;s completely gone, except it isn&#x27;t. We can click Div block. We can call this Horizontal divider, and we can set its background color to a lighter color or a darker color. I can drop the opacity a little bit. Let&#x27;s do 80%, and we&#x27;ll press Escape. Let&#x27;s also add some space between the heading, which is called Heading 2, but let&#x27;s call it the utility heading, and we&#x27;ll add some margin underneath that. Let&#x27;s do ... While we&#x27;re in the habit of it, let&#x27;s do 30 pixels. 38 may be a little intense here. Let&#x27;s drop that to 32, and we&#x27;ll set the line height to unitless.</p><p>Now, it might be a little wide. The 404 details at 320 might be wide. Let&#x27;s reduce that. Let&#x27;s say the maximum width is 260. Let&#x27;s put something behind it. Let&#x27;s drag a Div block right into utility page rep. Then we&#x27;ll make sure our assets for our utility pages are dragged in. Let&#x27;s make sure those are added. In this Div block, we&#x27;re going to use this Blue texture. We&#x27;re going to drag it right into the Div block, and that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s our 404 page, except we&#x27;re not done. Let&#x27;s add a class to this. We&#x27;ll call it Circle Image. We&#x27;ll set a width of 600 pixels, and let&#x27;s round it. We can just set our radius, our border radius to 50%. that&#x27;ll make a circle out of this.</p><p>Now, if this image did not have a perfect one by one aspect ratio, 50% would create an oval. If it was wider, it would create an oval this way. If it was taller, it would create an oval this way. But because it&#x27;s a square image, it&#x27;s 50%. We want to set its position to absolute, but let&#x27;s not do that on the image. Let&#x27;s select its parent, the Div block, and we&#x27;ll say this is 404 interaction, which we&#x27;ll style this as. That&#x27;s the class name, and we&#x27;ll set its position to absolute.</p><p>Now, because we set it to absolute, it&#x27;s currently stacking on top of our other page content. So let&#x27;s select Utility Page Content, and let&#x27;s unlock Z index. By switching this to relative, it&#x27;s automatically placing itself on top. Just to be safe, let&#x27;s set a Z index of one to make sure it&#x27;s stacked on top of anything underneath. Let&#x27;s select that 404 interaction. Now we can move it freely. So, of course, if we added a transform, we could move it to the right, to the left, whatever we want. Let&#x27;s undo there, and let&#x27;s delete that move, because there&#x27;s one more thing to add to our Div block. Let&#x27;s duplicate with our circle image selected. Let&#x27;s duplicate it.</p><p>Now, we have two of these images. We&#x27;re going to select the second one, and we&#x27;re going to turn it into a glow. So first let&#x27;s create a combo class. Let&#x27;s call this Glow. This is Circle Image Glow, and we&#x27;re going to change a few things here. Let&#x27;s set it to absolute position, and we want it to fill the space available inside its parent container. So we have a little shortcut here, which is full. Let&#x27;s press that, and now it&#x27;s set to 0% from the boundary of its parent. That&#x27;s exactly what we want, but we also want ... We&#x27;re on the glow effect here. Let&#x27;s add a filter to blur this dramatically. Let&#x27;s blur it, let&#x27;s say, 75 pixels, and this is a good effect. This is okay on its own. We might also want to increase the saturation a little bit. So if this is 0%, this is 100%. Let&#x27;s increase that. Let&#x27;s go all the way to 200%.</p><p>It&#x27;s also stacking. Right now, it&#x27;s stacking on top of the circle image. So what we can do is use Z index a little more specifically on the first circle image, not the glow. We want that to have a higher Z index. We want that to stack on top of the glow. So let&#x27;s set its Z index to two, and then we&#x27;ll set the one underneath. It&#x27;s inheriting two, because it&#x27;s a combo class. So we&#x27;ll set this to one. Then, of course, with our utility page content, let&#x27;s set it to a higher number. Let&#x27;s set it to three. Right now, looking at the frosted glass, it might work with a darker effect by default. Let&#x27;s switch this to black with a higher opacity. Maybe a little bit lower, like 40. That looks pretty good.</p><p>Let&#x27;s press Escape, and let&#x27;s change one more thing. If we want to resize our 404 interaction, again, the size, this is set to auto width and height. The size is being determined from our circle image, our base circle image. So we can just hold down Option and resize this at any time. Notice how the glow is resizing with it. So maybe something a little bit more like this would look good. Let&#x27;s make it a nice, round number, and let&#x27;s add a quick interaction. Let&#x27;s go to interactions, and we&#x27;re going to add a page trigger while the mouse is moving in the viewport.</p><p>On Mouse move, we want to play a mouse animation, which we&#x27;re designing right now, and we&#x27;re going to add one. We&#x27;re going to call this 404 Interaction. Here&#x27;s how it works with X and Y for mouse position. When the mouse exposition is 0%, that&#x27;s when the mouse is all the way to the left. When the mouse exposition is 100% down here, that&#x27;s what happens when the mouse is all the way to the right. Same with Y. 0% is at the top. 100% is at the bottom.</p><p>So at 0%, let&#x27;s move this to the left, and we can use pixel values if we&#x27;d like, or we can even use VW. We can say minus 10 VW or maybe minus 20 VW. It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s leaving the glow behind, but we can change that in just a moment. In fact, we can change it right now by changing it from selected element to the class. Since we&#x27;re affecting the base class, it&#x27;ll affect the base class and the glow combo class. So if that exposition is minus 20 VW when we&#x27;re at 0%, let&#x27;s change 100% to positive 20 VW. So just like that, we can turn on live preview and move to the left and right, and it&#x27;s following our mouse position.</p><p>Let&#x27;s do the same thing with our Y actions. Let&#x27;s add 0%. We&#x27;re going to move it up. We&#x27;ll do minus 20. We&#x27;ll do viewport height, and we&#x27;ll do the same thing on the bottom. We&#x27;ll do 20 viewport height. So what would that look like? Let&#x27;s turn on live preview, and it&#x27;s not going to work as expected. That&#x27;s because we have to make sure on the Y action as well. We&#x27;re affecting the class. So select the class. Turn on live preview again, and just like that, we&#x27;re following not just left and right, but up and down.</p><p>Now, we can add a bit of a delay on this. We can add some damping. Let&#x27;s turn on smoothing. Let&#x27;s turn that up to something like 95%. Now if we go into preview mode, we can see it follows, but with a little bit of a delay. Of course, if we want to increase the drama of the effect, we can go into the 404 interaction and increase these numbers. Again, we can make this minus 30. We can make this one 30. Then we can do the same thing here. We can make minus 30 and positive 30. Preview, and now the effect is a little more pronounced. Of course, we might want to go back in and change the smoothing to something a little more dramatic, like 99%. Let&#x27;s go to preview mode. That is significantly more dramatic.</p><p>In fact, let&#x27;s time how long it&#x27;s going to take to get from the bottom left corner of the screen to the bottom left corner of the screen. It was already there. That&#x27;s part two. Let&#x27;s move onto our final part, which is our frosted glass effect. We&#x27;ll go out of preview mode, and we&#x27;re going to effect this on the frosted glass class. Now, it&#x27;s always a good idea to check a site like caniuse.com so we can see what the compatibility is of something like backdrop filter. As of the recording of this video, Firefox, for instance, does not support this by default. So keep that in mind, and test on as many browsers as possible. But we&#x27;ll switch back over to Webflow, and we&#x27;ll enable this on frosted glass.</p><p>Now, we&#x27;ve included the custom code down below so you can take a look at that and try this out for yourself. So let&#x27;s add a custom code a bit. We&#x27;ll scroll down to the bottom. We&#x27;ll add an embed element, and we&#x27;ll put that right inside the page body. We&#x27;re going to paste in the custom code. We&#x27;ve added this snippet down below. We&#x27;ll just paste in, and this is saying a few things. This is a style. We&#x27;re applying it to frosted glass. Again, that&#x27;s the name of our class here, and we&#x27;ve added a hyphen since by default, class names that have spaces in them are hyphenated in code.</p><p>All the code is saying is this. It&#x27;s adding a backdrop filter. This is adding a backdrop filter in which everything behind this boundary, frosted glass, everything behind that boundary is going to increase its saturation to 200%. It&#x27;ll increase its blur from non-existent to 10 pixels, and it&#x27;ll keep the brightness where it is. You can change this value later based on what looks right. The next line is saying the same exact thing. The first one just has a WebKit prefix. So if you change a value in one of these, make sure to change it in the other as well.</p><p>So, again, frosted-glass with the hyphen, and we&#x27;re going to press Save and close. Just like that, we have our frosted glass effect, but here&#x27;s the impressive part. If we go in and go to Preview, we can see the interaction right behind our frosted glass. Now, if we want to go in and change those values, let&#x27;s go out. With our HTML embed selected, let&#x27;s press return, and let&#x27;s change this. Maybe we want to increase the blur. Let&#x27;s try 30 pixels, 30 pixels on each of these. Save and close, and now it&#x27;s an even blurrier effect. You can see more of a blur behind the frosted glass.</p><p>But that&#x27;s it for now. We covered our 404 structure, we covered our styling, and we even added custom code for the frosted glass design. We&#x27;re going to take this even further in the next part of this course as we cover password-protected pages for sharing password-protected work with potential clients, clients of our completely fictional UX designer named Megan.</p><p>[Grimur] 404 means different things to everybody.

Sometimes we want to offer something specific, we don&#x27;t want everyone to see, maybe a potential client. We&#x27;ll create a password-protected page, then we&#x27;ll design the page that prompts users for the actual password. Common passwords include:¬†</p><p>[McGuire and Sara] Iceland, keyboard, how are you doing that?</p><p>[Sara] You didn&#x27;t add a password to your notes.</p><p>[McGuire and Sara] So, you&#x27;re just proving a point?</p><p>[Sara] Okay.</p><p>[McGuire and Sara] Brussels, keyboard, Cinema 4D, Premiere, Resolve, iPhone.</p><p>[Sara] I can do this all day.</p><p>[McGuire and Sara] 1, 7, 3, 4, 6, 7, 3, 2, 1, 4, 7, 6, Charlie, 3, 2, 7, 8, 9, 7, 7, 7, 6, 4, 3, Tango, 7, 3, 2, Victor, 7, 3, 1, 1, 7, 8, 8, 8, 7, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7, 6, 4, 3, 7, 6, lock. Ikea has mediocre food.</p><p>[Sara] Rude.</p><p>[McGuire] Let&#x27;s start by creating a password-protected page. Let&#x27;s go in. Instead of going to the utility page first, let&#x27;s create our password-protected page. We&#x27;ll call it, password-protected page, press return.</p><p>Now, this is going to be an advanced design. Let&#x27;s go to our ad panel and let&#x27;s grab a heading, we&#x27;ll drag it right in, double click to edit, secret, press escape to de-select. That&#x27;s the password-protected page. Let&#x27;s move on to the second part and design our password input. Let&#x27;s go to the utility page for password. Now, the beauty of designing with classes and having already designed one utility page before, is we can copy and paste and have a great starting point. So for right now, let&#x27;s delete this image. Let&#x27;s delete this heading. Let&#x27;s keep this field label for password, enter your password, and let&#x27;s keep this button as well. Now, we can select our utility page form. Let&#x27;s go into our navigator here, open utility page content, utility page form, and remove the existing class and apply instead, you guessed it, frosted glass. Press return.</p><p>So, we&#x27;re inheriting those styles we designed on our previous page. Let&#x27;s go and add a heading. Let&#x27;s add an H1. We&#x27;ll do this above password and we&#x27;ll call this, this page, this project is password-protected, or we could say this content is password-protected. And there&#x27;s a few things we can do here. For instance, on our heading, we can create a new styling. In fact, let&#x27;s see what happens if we grab our traditional heading. That&#x27;s okay, we might want to duplicate this and create our own style for this page. Let&#x27;s say, password heading and we can change a few things here. Let&#x27;s go down and decrease our size. Let&#x27;s set a line height of 1.2, hyphen to set unit less, maybe 1.1, and we can set a maximum width on this. Let&#x27;s narrow it a little more. Say 280, and we&#x27;re just going to add a few more things.</p><p>Let&#x27;s go in and add our SVG, this lock. Press escape. The default size looks great. Maybe add a little bit of margin underneath, 15 pixels or so. Let&#x27;s rename this to, lock. And if we start messing with frosted glass, for instance, if we start changing the padding here, let&#x27;s just add a bunch of padding for this example. And if we go back to our 404, it&#x27;s using the same class. So, it&#x27;s also going to make that one giant as well and we don&#x27;t want that. So, instead with frosted glass selected, let&#x27;s bring that back to 30 pixels on all sides. And with our lock selected, let&#x27;s add some margins, so there&#x27;s a little space above this, maybe 30 pixels. That looks pretty good. Now, we can always add a paragraph for instance, we can add a paragraph in between these items. So, with our password heading, let&#x27;s reduce this to maybe 20 or 30 pixels. Let&#x27;s do 30 pixels and let&#x27;s set a paragraph here. Again, we can set a maximum width. We can set this to 60. Let&#x27;s delete a bunch of this extra text here.</p><p>Let me put some of it back and stop right here. We have a few lines maybe right here, let&#x27;s rename paragraph three to, password paragraph. And usually we&#x27;d set constraints on the parent element like the frosted glass, but because we don&#x27;t want to affect both pages or make any changes that are going to negatively affect our other page, we&#x27;re setting this on password paragraph. Let&#x27;s add some margin, 30 pixels here as well. Let&#x27;s drop the opacity a little bit more, it&#x27;s 0.9. Let&#x27;s drop it a little bit. And of course our submit button, we have a class here. Let&#x27;s look at our buttons button and we have utility button from before. Let&#x27;s press escape to de-select, that looks pretty good for now. Keep in mind, frosted glass does not have the frosted effect. This is a great plain password page, it looks okay. Let&#x27;s do two things to change this.</p><p>One, let&#x27;s go back to the 404 and let&#x27;s grab that HTML embed, copy it to our clipboard. And we&#x27;ll go back to password. In our body, we&#x27;ll press paste and we&#x27;ll move that to the top. If we preview, that effect is not very visible. How can we make it visible? Let&#x27;s build an interaction. So, let&#x27;s de-select here. And for right now let&#x27;s open utility page rep and for our utility page content, let&#x27;s set its display to none, just for a moment because we want to build this interaction. Let&#x27;s go in and build an interaction. We&#x27;re going to use a grid. Two rows, two columns. Let&#x27;s change the color of our outlines, so it doesn&#x27;t sere. So, maybe use black, much better contrast and let&#x27;s add a bunch of columns. Let&#x27;s do, let&#x27;s say seven columns, eight columns, no seven columns and seven rows. Let&#x27;s call our grid, password interaction.</p><p>And if we preview now, the grid, it&#x27;s just a guide. There&#x27;s nothing actually there. We have to put content inside. So, let&#x27;s add a Div block and we&#x27;re going to build one of these and then we&#x27;ll copy and paste to have a bunch of them. So, let&#x27;s go in and password cell and it&#x27;s going to have seven children. And here&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do. We&#x27;ll add another Div block with password cell selected, command K, Div block that puts a Div block inside that Div block. We&#x27;ll call this one, password cell color. We&#x27;re going to choose a default. Let&#x27;s go and start with red. We&#x27;re going to go through the color spectrum ROYGBIV, so let&#x27;s start with a red color.</p><p>And we&#x27;re just going to copy and paste. So, now there are two sibling elements inside of our password cell. This one, we&#x27;re going to add a combo class. This one is going to follow the spectrum order. Orange, and we&#x27;ll set its color to an orange. Same thing, copy and paste. This time we&#x27;re going to duplicate the combo class, yellow. And of course we&#x27;ll select a yellow color for this. We can rearrange the order later, let&#x27;s copy and paste. We&#x27;re going to add another one. This time, we&#x27;re going to duplicate the combo class and call it green. The color of course, green. Copy and paste. This one&#x27;s going to be a duplicate class. Orange, yellow, green. Blue. We&#x27;ll choose a blue color. Copy and paste. Indigo. And we&#x27;ll choose an indigo.</p><p>And finally, copy and paste one more time. Duplicate this class, violet. Then of course, let&#x27;s choose a color towards violet. Almost a pink, right here. Let&#x27;s go up to a pink color like that. And let&#x27;s rearrange, red is all the way out of view here. Red, orange, let&#x27;s move this up here. Let&#x27;s do yellow right here. Green should be next. Use blue, indigo and violet pink. And because all of these are combo classes, we can go to the base class and effect all of them at once.</p><p>For instance, if we size these two 20 by 20, it resizes all of them to 20 by 20. Let&#x27;s remove both of those because what we really want to do is set its position to absolute. now something we want to do here, when it&#x27;s absolutely positioned is we want it to fill the available space inside its parent. So right now, its parent, because nothing else is set to relative, is look to the body. We wanna select this password cell and set its position to relative. Now, we need to give our password interaction, this grid, a defined width and height. Let&#x27;s set the width to, let&#x27;s say 75% of whichever view port dimension is minimum. Let&#x27;s do vmin and the height to 75 vmin as well. So, what that means is we have these cells colors. Let&#x27;s decrease the opacity a little bit. Let&#x27;s drop the opacity of these cell colors to a lower value, maybe 20%. And it&#x27;s getting kind of grayish because the colors presently are stacking, but I&#x27;m going to do something different here. In fact, we&#x27;ll select our utility page rep and we&#x27;ll add transform settings. Let&#x27;s set a children perspective of 1000 pixels, and this enables a 3D camera effect. So now, we can go into the password cell color and one by one, we can start moving them backwards, along the Z axis. Here&#x27;s how that&#x27;ll work. On orange, let&#x27;s move this back a little bit. You can see it&#x27;s moving back. Let&#x27;s say minus 10, because this is easier to count for us. And then the second one, this one&#x27;s yellow. Let&#x27;s move it back.</p><p>Let&#x27;s move it back to minus 20. Same pattern here. This one will move, minus 30. This one will move back minus 40, minus four, zero. And we&#x27;ll continue that pattern, minus 50. And then of course, one more minus 700 or minus 60. So, before we create our interaction, let&#x27;s fill up the rest of the cells with password cell selected. Let&#x27;s go ahead and create a Symbol out of this. That way, we can make a change on any one structure and it&#x27;ll affect all of the cells. Let&#x27;s create Symbol.</p><p>We&#x27;ll call this, &quot;password cell.&quot; And we&#x27;ll go back to the instance, then we&#x27;re just going to copy and paste several times and you can see that 3D perspective take effect as we do that. It should be just enough. That&#x27;s our password interaction, at least the grid itself. And now, if we apply any type of transform, that&#x27;s a rotation, so let&#x27;s rotate. We can see that 3D effect in action, we&#x27;ll make this a lot better than the interactions tab. But just to demonstrate, we can do that in 2D and 3D transforms, holding down option to click and remove that transform effect because here&#x27;s where the fun starts. We&#x27;re going to create an interaction, over in the interactions tab. On the page, let&#x27;s add a trigger when the mouse is moving in the view port, and we&#x27;re only going to do this on desktop and above. Let&#x27;s create a mouse animation. Let&#x27;s add a new one. This will be called, password interaction.</p><p>And when the mouse is on the left side of the screen, let&#x27;s rotate this. Again, the password interaction grid is selected. So, let&#x27;s rotate that to the left. Let&#x27;s do minus 40. That looks pretty good. On the second one, we&#x27;ll do a positive value of 40 and let&#x27;s add two more y actions, it&#x27;s moving up and down. We&#x27;ll do rotate. Up here, we&#x27;ll do, let&#x27;s say 30 or maybe 20. And then, on the bottom one, we&#x27;re going to do the same thing. We&#x27;ll do minus 20. Of course, at any time we can go into live preview or just go into preview mode to see how this is going to look in real time. And that looks pretty good. Now, let&#x27;s make some changes. Let&#x27;s go out of preview mode and for our password cell let&#x27;s double click to edit our Symbol. With our password cell selected, let&#x27;s press done and let&#x27;s change our background color of the password cell itself to black.</p><p>And the top password cell color is positioned at, let&#x27;s check... There is no 3D transform on this one. So, let&#x27;s move it back, let&#x27;s say one pixel. And let&#x27;s go back to the instance preview. Now, I have this darker color in front. There&#x27;s a few things we can do here. Number one, we can make sure that black color actually matches our background color. So, let&#x27;s check our utility page wrap, let&#x27;s see what that color is. In fact, we can go here and set that color as a swatch, dark, dark, dark gray, blue, save that. And we can use that in the password cell, double click to edit, and we&#x27;ll go in and change that to match. Now, if we go into preview mode, we&#x27;re matching. Let&#x27;s increase that depth and rather than reposition, rather than change the Z value for each and every position of all of these, we can just go in and make one change on the password cell itself.</p><p>We can emphasize that Z depth by making one transform, and that is scaling along the Z axis. The higher this number, let&#x27;s make this much more dramatic, the more it scales the depth value for each of these. Let&#x27;s do something like five or six. Then, we&#x27;ll go to preview. We have a depth right there. That looks pretty good. Could we take it further? Yes, but let&#x27;s see what the frosted glass looks like in front of this. So, let&#x27;s go back to our utility page content, of course, remove, reset our styling there so we can see it. Let&#x27;s select our password interaction, what we just created and let&#x27;s make sure this is positioned absolute. And because the utility page content, because that is Z index of three, that means it&#x27;s going to stack on top of the password interaction and because we have the HTML embed, it&#x27;s going to blur everything behind this. So, let&#x27;s go to preview mode and see what the interaction looks like.</p><p>Now, if we want those colors to be more vibrant and we want to decrease or increase that opacity, we can always do that. Let&#x27;s open up the password interaction, double-click the password cell, and of course select our base class password cell color, increase that opacity. And we can make it as vibrant as we want, let&#x27;s say 50%. Let&#x27;s go back and preview, then we can see what it would look like on a more vibrant set of colors. And really quickly, let&#x27;s add smoothing. Right now, it&#x27;s pretty responsive to our mouse position. Let&#x27;s go out of here and back to the interaction. Mouse move, and we&#x27;re going to add smoothing, let&#x27;s make this, let&#x27;s say 96%. Then, we can see the smoothing, the damping has increased. Now, if we do want to see that red a little more boldly, we can go in and in our style panel, we can move this back.</p><p>Instead of one pixel, we can make this minus 10 and we&#x27;ll have to go in sequence, which will time-lapse right now. Due to the magic of editing, we&#x27;ll look back and it&#x27;s done. Let&#x27;s go back and preview mode. We can see everything stacked, including now, even spacing between the black and the red all the way through the ROYGBIV spectrum. Now, we haven&#x27;t connected these two things, our two steps here.</p><p>Let&#x27;s go out of preview mode and let&#x27;s connect our page. So, if this is a password-protected page, let&#x27;s press the cog. We&#x27;re going to add password protection. We&#x27;re going to type a password. Ikea, we&#x27;ll press save. And once this is published, if someone wants to access our secret page, they&#x27;ll have to know that the password is Ikea and that&#x27;s it. We created a password-protected page and we created the password page that shows up to let users type in a password that lets them access the password-protected page, is a very confusing sentence. But we did both, the page or pages we want to protect and the page that prompts the user to enter a password. That&#x27;s password protection in our portfolio, project. Grimur...</p><p>[Grimur] I bet you can‚Äôt guess my password. If you guessed #21DayPortfolio, you‚Äôd be wrong, because that‚Äôs definitely not my password. But it is Stacy‚Äôs.

In this lesson, we&#x27;ll cover some of the accessibility considerations that can dramatically impact your site&#x27;s effectiveness. It won&#x27;t be perfect, we&#x27;re still going to miss things, but just as we&#x27;ve been thinking about some of these contrast ratios legibility, there are active steps we can take to make our portfolio better. And you&#x27;ll see this pattern throughout the rest of the course. The idea that we can iterate on and improve our portfolios in ways that make material differences in accessibility, search engine performance, and admittedly, the next lesson is a design review with Sara. So we&#x27;re going to do the best we can, so she does not... And she&#x27;s texting.</p><p>[Sara] Oh no, I&#x27;m not texting you.</p><p>[McGuire] Not buying that for a second.</p><p>[Sara] I&#x27;m working on it.</p><p>[McGuire] We&#x27;ll make all of this happen in five parts. We&#x27;ll cover alt text for screen readers and search engines. We&#x27;ll do color contrast for text elements. We&#x27;ll identify any empty links. We&#x27;ll check on our headings for hierarchical-whatever-it&#x27;s-called-when-you&#x27;re-setting-proper-hierarchy. We&#x27;ll do form input labels, and finally ‚Äî</p><p>[Sara] That was already five.</p><p>[McGuire] Let&#x27;s start with alt text. This is what search engines capture and it&#x27;s also what you can access if you&#x27;re using a screen reader like VoiceOver on macOS. There&#x27;s a couple ways to go about doing this. First up, let&#x27;s open up the Audit panel and this will show us some of the alt text that&#x27;s missing on certain assets in our project. But it doesn&#x27;t just show it to us. We can actually click through. We can dismiss the notification if we want. We could ignore this asset for now, but we can also go right to it. Take me to the fix. So we can press that, and it takes us to Stockholm. And like we said, there are a couple of ways to do this. We can add alt text on the asset itself. So if the asset&#x27;s used in multiple places in the project, if we&#x27;ve used this image as an inline image throughout the project, we can affect it once. So we can determine here if it&#x27;s descriptive ‚Äî if a description would add value to a human or a search engine to better understand this. We can type, &quot;screenshot of Stockholm-&quot;</p><p>[Sara] It&#x27;s Stockholm.</p><p>[McGuire] ... &quot;website,&quot; and we can close that out. We can do this by asset. So we can go to the second one as well and we can do a description here too. But here&#x27;s the thing to consider. Are these adding value to the content on the site? In other words, this hero section, is it decorative or is it descriptive? Will descriptions of each of these six sites add value to search engines or value to humans? And that&#x27;s a fair question. We could switch this to decorative. In fact, that we can switch all of these if we don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re adding value by adding descriptions to each of these images. There are plenty of examples throughout our project. So we&#x27;ll leave this as is for now and leave it to you to determine what works best on your portfolio. Before we move on from this section, let&#x27;s show the second way to add alt text, and this is on a per element basis.</p><p>So if we go in here and open up hero image, right now we&#x27;re using... We&#x27;re grabbing the alt text from the asset. Again, that&#x27;s what we just said in the Asset panel. If we want to override that, we can do a custom description or we can notate that this is decorative. Let&#x27;s close out of this one and let&#x27;s go on to something else like this. We can go into this hero image, we can mark it. Just on the asset itself, we can say, &quot;This is a decorative image.&quot; Let&#x27;s close out and continue because a Collection list provides an incredible opportunity for alt text. Here&#x27;s how. We can go into our Collection, into our projects, and we realize for each of these, we have a project image. If someone tries to access this image on a screen reader, it&#x27;ll sound like this.</p><p>[macOS VoiceOver] 5430960300DV65E40566621_sunset.JPEG</p><p>Not great, but we can make it better. Let&#x27;s go back out of this item and we&#x27;ll go into our settings for our Collection, our projects settings, and we can add a new custom field. We can add a field, that&#x27;s just going to be a plain text field, which we can call, alt text for project image. Let&#x27;s save that field. just so it&#x27;s organized, let&#x27;s move it right underneath the project image and we can save our Collection. Now, if we go into Architectural website, we can add the alt text for this image, &quot;sun setting with mountain in foreground.&quot; Let&#x27;s press save. Let&#x27;s move on to our next one. We can go into Social network and do the same thing, and this will be really quick. &quot;Dark cloud hovering over sea.&quot; Press save. You can do this on each of your Collection items. The idea though, is this: We can close out of our CMS and on these images, we can select the selected project&#x27;s image, go into the cog and we can get our alt text. We can assign alt text from that field, from the alt text for project image field.</p><p>Now that means our sunset description, we just wrote ‚Äî that alt text we just wrote ‚Äî will tie to this image. Same thing for our cloud here. This is a great exercise to go through. As we scroll through, we can see we can do this for the rest of our Collection list. We can go back in and add those. But what we&#x27;re looking for is any image in our project that doesn&#x27;t have a description, that doesn&#x27;t currently have alt text. So we&#x27;ll continue scrolling through here. We&#x27;re going to come back to this in just a moment for some of the other parts of this lesson. But if we look at our footer here, there are three more image elements. Image of Twitter, this is the Twitter logo, this is the Instagram logo, and, of course, the LinkedIn logo. If these aren&#x27;t used in different ways throughout our project, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to go to our assets and add some alt text there. Descriptive &quot;Instagram logo.&quot; For the next one, we&#x27;ll do &quot;LinkedIn logo.&quot; Of course for the last one, we&#x27;ll go and add &quot;Twitter logo.&quot;</p><p>But that&#x27;s the bottom of our homepage. Let&#x27;s move on to our other pages. Let&#x27;s go into our contact page. We&#x27;re just going in order from top to bottom. So in the contact page, in this case, we really don&#x27;t have any additional images. Since this is a Symbol, and since these use the same assets we&#x27;ve now set alt text to in our Assets panel, we&#x27;re good on this page. So let&#x27;s move on to our password-protected page. Secret. Okay. Let&#x27;s go on to password. Here&#x27;s an example of a lock. Now this could be a great example of decorative versus something that actually has meaningful content. So if we want descriptive text here, we can add it. So if we want to go into the lock itself and say... Let&#x27;s use a custom description &quot;lock icon.&quot; Or if we don&#x27;t think it adds value, we could go to decorative. Let&#x27;s leave it as lock icon right now and move on.</p><p>Something to note about this grid, the interaction behind this is, this is decorative. These are Divs. They&#x27;re Div blocks and they have a color, but overall, these are decorative. So we&#x27;re going to leave those as is for now. Let&#x27;s continue from password to 404. Now another decorative element, this is a circle image, so let&#x27;s make sure it&#x27;s decorative. We&#x27;ll click the cog and we&#x27;ll mark it as decorative. Now you might remember we use this asset twice. We use it on the top and we use it underneath to create the glow effect. So we could use the alt text from the asset, close this out and just go into the asset and say, &quot;Hey, when anyone&#x27;s using this asset, we&#x27;re going to use it in a decorative format.&quot; That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s decorative and it doesn&#x27;t convey meaning. So let&#x27;s close that, and now both of these will inherit that. We can click the circle image. It&#x27;s using that all text from the asset, so it&#x27;s being declared as decorative from the asset. Same thing with the circle image. The same thing it&#x27;s referencing the asset.</p><p>Let&#x27;s continue. That&#x27;s the 404. Let&#x27;s move on to our projects template. Now, first thing, we have project main image right here, and we can click the cog and we know that we can access this because we added it before to get the alt text from the projects Collection. So let&#x27;s grab that alt text for the project image, because this is the project image. So as we switch between each of these, it&#x27;ll refresh with the project image and in each of those, it&#x27;s going to grab the alt text associated with it. So let&#x27;s close out of here and continue down. So what do we do about this project grid because there are multiple images? So if we select any one of them, if we click in here, we can see, we can get this image from project images, but because it&#x27;s a multi-image field, we don&#x27;t have that same option.</p><p>So what do we do? Well, we can go into our CMS, we can go into projects and we can go into any one of them. Let&#x27;s start with our Architectural website. If we go down to our multi-image field, our project images, there&#x27;s three little dots. If we press that, we can edit the alt text. We could do this on each image. Because these are examples, we&#x27;ll use lorem ipsum, but if you have meaningful images in a multi-image field like this, it&#x27;s important to add descriptive text to each of them in the alt text field. Let&#x27;s save that change and we&#x27;ll close out. Let&#x27;s scroll down and continue. We have other projects here. Again, it&#x27;s a project image. So let&#x27;s go in here. We can get the alt text from alt text for project image. Again, this is a Collection list, so a change on any one Collection item will affect the others. So you can see this one&#x27;s already getting the alt text, and so is this one. Right there, getting the alt text from the alt text for project&#x27;s image. Let&#x27;s continue down. Everything&#x27;s looking pretty good here. But that&#x27;s alt text.</p><p>Let&#x27;s move on to our next category which is color contrast on text. Let&#x27;s go back to our homepage. We&#x27;ll just go in top-down order for all of these and take a look at some of the contrast opportunities we have. So we&#x27;re looking for contrast between the foreground and the background. The foreground being the text, whether it&#x27;s a heading a paragraph, text on a button and the background, which is usually the background color behind the text. So we can see the heading color is dark, it&#x27;s actually black, and we can see the Body (all pages) color, we can see is FDFDFD. So that contrast ratio is going to be really high. How high? Well, if we click black, we can see it&#x27;s AAA rated, which is the highest rated contrast ratio at a ratio of 20.65 to 1. High contrast, very legible. Let&#x27;s check the text block here, because this is a little bit lower. This is 0.7. If we click that, we can see it&#x27;s still AAA rated, with a contrast ratio of 8.44 to 1, which is great.</p><p>Let&#x27;s continue down and we&#x27;re just going to select each of these. As we do this, we can get better. We know that the black contrast ratio is 20.65 to 1. We can click that 20.65 because we know the background color, and then we know that this color is black on top of that. So let&#x27;s look at these elements because there are a few ways to do this. We&#x27;ve been showing the foreground against the background. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking for. We&#x27;re looking at the contrast between the foreground and background. But on this project type preview, we see a lower opacity, 0.63, and we can see that&#x27;s currently failing our contrast check. Contrast ratio of three to one, not very legible. We have two options here. We can increase the opacity until we get to at least AA. So let&#x27;s bring this up. Probably... There we go. It looks like 86%.</p><p>Now we&#x27;re achieving AA, but there&#x27;s another way to do this. If we look this red, this rust color, we&#x27;ve set this in our CMS. If we&#x27;d like, we could go back to our Architectural website. Let&#x27;s copy this to our clipboard so we can always change it back, and let&#x27;s change this to a darker color. Again, there are two ways to change contrast like this. We can increase the brightness of the foreground or we can decrease the brightness of the background. So when we do that, let&#x27;s save, let&#x27;s close, now the contrast ratio is going to be very high for this. We&#x27;re getting 8.31, and we can even go lower. We&#x27;re still getting AA all the way back down at about 58% opacity. Now that color is not Sara-approved.</p><p>[Sara] I do not approve.</p><p>[McGuire] Noted. Thank you. Let&#x27;s change it back. We can go to our CMS and because we copied this to our clipboard, we can quickly replace that project color, save, close, and choose an opacity that passes at least AA. Let&#x27;s bring that to say 90%. same thing down here. In fact, if we&#x27;re going to use that lower opacity white color and we get that just right, maybe we want 87%, we can save that, even with the opacity as a swatch. We can call this translucent white. Press create, and now we can reuse it. So here we know the contrast is going to be low, so we can click that to see what it, 2.84. Let&#x27;s use that translucent white, and that brought it up to 4.59. Now these are going to be higher. We can always check them just to make sure, but we can go in here and say, &quot;Translucent white.&quot; That&#x27;s great. 5.59. Same thing here, we know it&#x27;s the same because we&#x27;re using that same swatch against it.</p><p>So here, higher contrast here, higher contrast. Let&#x27;s continue. Let&#x27;s double click into here and see what this darker paragraph is showing us. That&#x27;s 0.68. That should be high enough. We&#x27;re getting AAA, 7.81. What about the submit button? Now, a lot of times with cascading or in this case text inheritance, the color that&#x27;s absorbed isn&#x27;t always the color that ends up previewing in the canvas. So let&#x27;s make sure we set this to white so we can use our contrast ratio checker correctly. It&#x27;s 5.76, that&#x27;s looking pretty good against our main brand color. So to demonstrate this, we can always go in. Let&#x27;s say we change this to dark, dark, dark, gray, blue. We know that contrast is going to be higher. We can go back and see it&#x27;s now 17.92. But for now, switch it back to the brand color, and we&#x27;ll hit escape to go back.</p><p>What about the text down here? What we know, we just learned about that contrast ratio and the submit button. It should be the same here. So let&#x27;s select paragraph two. Let&#x27;s do a little housekeeping, call this, footer paragraph and let&#x27;s check it&#x27;s contrast. Again, 5.76. This one, if it&#x27;s the same color, we know it&#x27;s going to be the same thing. Let&#x27;s go here. In this case, this is a good example of checking the contrast ratio without necessarily applying a color on the actual class. Because this color, the value comes from all links. That&#x27;s where we&#x27;re getting the white color. So that&#x27;s our homepage. Let&#x27;s move on to our contact page, we&#x27;ve already checked most of this. Again, this is what we&#x27;re going to get in the habit of doing because this is a Symbol that&#x27;s used on a lot of different pages.</p><p>Larger heading, let&#x27;s check it&#x27;s contrast. Of course, that&#x27;s our main brand color on FDFDFD, which is 5.66. Looking pretty good. Scroll down here, that&#x27;s the footer. Let&#x27;s move on. Let&#x27;s check our password-protected. That&#x27;s great. Let&#x27;s move on to the password page. Now this page is a little different. Just glancing at it, the contrast may already be high enough, but keep in mind that the contrast checker is not always looking at all aspects of an interaction, and it&#x27;s not looking to validate the custom code. So we have the frosted glass effect here, and of course we have this interaction. So the things behind the text are constantly changing. In this case, the contrast does seem to be high enough and keep in mind if we&#x27;re in Firefox, we know the frosted glass won&#x27;t render.</p><p>So if we go into our HTML embed, press return, and let&#x27;s just go up right before our class name here and put forward slash, asterisk and that&#x27;ll temporarily disable our code. Let&#x27;s go in. This is what people will see on Firefox. So it might make sense, especially if we&#x27;re indexing for higher contrast to increase this to something like 70 on the hover. Then we can go back into the HTML embed, get rid of the comment opening here, and save and close. Preview. We&#x27;re still getting that translucent effect, is it as exciting? There&#x27;s probably a middle ground. So let&#x27;s check frosted glass and bring it down to, let&#x27;s do, 55. That looks pretty good. Higher contrast, let&#x27;s move forward. 404 page. Let&#x27;s go here, turn off preview mode. Same deal as before. In fact, frosted glass is just taking those same properties... Again, if we change it on one page, we know it changes on another because we&#x27;re using the frosted glass class.</p><p>It&#x27;s important to consider how these interactions are going to actually interact with the foreground text. The contrast ratio on page not found and everything here is pretty high especially when this isn&#x27;t there, but it might not be so legible when someone&#x27;s hovering over this. So it&#x27;s something to keep in mind. If you don&#x27;t have an intuitive way to quickly move something out of the way so people can read that text, it might not always be a great interaction. We were talking about that balance in the interactions lesson. It&#x27;s the same thing to consider here. Let&#x27;s go out of preview mode and we&#x27;ll go forward to our project&#x27;s template. We know this is higher contrast. Let&#x27;s go down to this one and check its contrast. 45, on the opacity we&#x27;re getting AA. Let&#x27;s increase that to AAA. Let&#x27;s do 55% opacity and we&#x27;ll continue. Looking here at project info, same deal AA. We could actually increase this to AAA again. Let&#x27;s do 66 and we might reuse this.</p><p>So let&#x27;s go ahead and add translucent black, and same thing here. Our project description, we want to check this text. So let&#x27;s go in. Let&#x27;s uncheck this to unlink it. We&#x27;ll select any paragraph. So now we&#x27;re editing all paragraphs when they&#x27;re nested inside of this project description. So let&#x27;s check that. Again, contrast AA. Let&#x27;s use our new swatch. So now we&#x27;re getting AAA and when we&#x27;re ready, let&#x27;s link it back. We&#x27;ll go here, we&#x27;ll get the text from project details. Continuing forward. Other projects. High contrast, we&#x27;ve checked these on the homepage. Those look pretty good. Let&#x27;s continue. We know our contact form and our footer are looking good. So let&#x27;s move on to links. What we&#x27;re doing here is we&#x27;re validating that if we present a link, it actually takes you somewhere. So let&#x27;s make sure that the links are both descriptive and active.</p><p>So we&#x27;ll go in here in our Navbar, we&#x27;ll just double click to edit the Navbar Symbol, and when we go in here, we have this brand link block. Again, this is an image. Let&#x27;s do housekeeping. Let&#x27;s call it logo and let&#x27;s click our brand, link block and make sure it actually takes us where we want it to take us. We want it to take us to a page. We want it to take us to the homepage. So let&#x27;s make sure it&#x27;s taking us to the homepage. Same deal with say hi. We want say hi taking us to a page in our project. We want it taking us to the contact page. What about projects? Well, there are a few ways to do this. We could have a dropdown, but it might be simpler to take people to our actual projects on our homepage, and we can do this by typing something specific into our URL. We&#x27;ll type a back tick and simply a forward slash and where we want it to take us on this page.</p><p>The forward slash is going to take us home to our homepage. Where do we want it to take us on this page? So we can use an anchor link for this. We&#x27;re going to do this backwards and that&#x27;s okay. We&#x27;re going to press shift three or the pound sign or hashtag and we&#x27;ll type, &quot;Projects.&quot; Whatever you put there needs to match the following. We&#x27;re on our homepage. We&#x27;re going to go down to our selected projects, we&#x27;ll click this section and we&#x27;ll also call it projects. Here&#x27;s what that does. When we publish our project, if we&#x27;re on the homepage and we press projects, it&#x27;ll take us down to selected projects. But here&#x27;s what else it&#x27;ll do. If we go to any other page on our project, let&#x27;s go to meditation app website, we can press projects, takes us back home and takes us to selected projects. So, that&#x27;s our Navbar.</p><p>Again, we now have this homepage, this brand link block taking us to the homepage. We have projects taking us down to projects, and we have say hi, which takes us to the contact page. Let&#x27;s hit escape to stop editing that and we&#x27;ll continue. All the way down the homepage, we have the submit button. Of course, this submits the form. That works okay. No other links in here. We&#x27;re looking good, but we do have some links to add in the footer. So right now, these are text blocks inside of link blocks. So let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;re using that correctly. In these cases, because this is a Collection list, and in the Collection list are four Collection items, for the website, the Social network, for each of these, we can select the link block and make sure it takes us to the current project. Again, current project will take it to whatever project is associated with this text. So if we go to preview mode and we press Social network, it takes us to Social network. If we go back down Meditation app... You get the idea.</p><p>So let&#x27;s escape from here and go back to our homepage. So we can scroll down and take one more look at our footer because we have three buttons down here, three links down here that are social links that take us to external sites. Since Megan is entirely fictional, we&#x27;re not going to put fake social media sites here, but just to demonstrate how this is done, we can always have an external URL and the URL can be whatever we want associated with, in this case, Twitter. So if we want Webflow&#x27;s Twitter, we can just paste Webflow&#x27;s Twitter. If we preview, we press the Twitter button, it takes you to Twitter. Now, out of preview mode, one thing to note here is we can open in this case when we were demonstrating in preview mode, it&#x27;s always going to open in a new tab, but the behavior on the published site is going to allow us to open either a new tab or if we want to replace the tab.</p><p>So if they&#x27;re on Megan&#x27;s portfolio and they press social link, do we want it to take over the tab or opening a new tab? In this case, we&#x27;re going to go with new tab. We can do the same thing for Instagram, for LinkedIn, any social buttons we have at the bottom. So those are our active links on the homepage. Let&#x27;s move on to our contact page. Should be the same. Let&#x27;s go onto password-protected. Okay, we&#x27;re good. Password, same deal here. Let&#x27;s go down to 404, same deal here. Let&#x27;s check that. Back to homepage. Does it take us home? Yes, it does. We don&#x27;t want to open that a new tab. We want it to take people from the 404 page straight to the homepage. Let&#x27;s go down to projects template. Scroll down. We do have something to catch here, which is right now, it&#x27;s getting the URL from the project link. So if we go over to our CMS, we can see where that&#x27;s going to take us. We&#x27;ll go to Investment app and see that it&#x27;s going to take us to google.com. There it is.</p><p>Let&#x27;s close out and try this out. Let&#x27;s go to preview mode and press view project, and there&#x27;s Google. Back to Webflow and out of preview mode. Let&#x27;s continue down. Other projects. We tested this earlier, but let&#x27;s test again. Social network takes us to Social network. Let&#x27;s go down to Investment app and that looks pretty good. That&#x27;s the rest of our links. Let&#x27;s move on to our fourth category, which is not going to include any manual changes on our site right now, but this is of course, headings. So something interesting with the hierarchy of headings, we can always realize that our big statement on the page is an H1. So this is, &quot;I elevate user experiences using telekinesis.&quot; That&#x27;s fine. We know this is text block. It&#x27;s mainly decorative texts. It&#x27;s not adding any tremendous value to this. This is our big heading. For each section, we have an H2. That&#x27;s correct. For everything nested inside each of those sections, we have an H3. Again, this is an H3. In terms of visual hierarchy, we&#x27;ve set this kind of sizing principles.</p><p>So the largest, most important heading is the largest, most important heading the second most important and so on. So let&#x27;s check our contact form. That should also be an H2. It is. That&#x27;s good. Let&#x27;s do the same thing on our contact page. We know that&#x27;s an H1, we know that&#x27;s an H2. Looking pretty good. Okay. Password page, should be an H1. It is an H1. Let&#x27;s go to our 404. Now this is text. It should be. 404 isn&#x27;t adding value, but page not found is. That&#x27;s our H1, our big heading. That&#x27;s a really important point. The big heading or the most important heading doesn&#x27;t always have to be the most important, big thing on the page, but it needs to be the thing that provides the most descriptive relevant value to users, to search engines that are looking for what&#x27;s this page about? The 404 is not so much about the number 4,0,4. 404 is about the page not being found. So this is relevant.</p><p>Let&#x27;s move on to projects template. H1, pretty good. Text, this is decorative text. Is looking pretty good. This should be an H2. Keep in mind, this is referencing rich text. So for that, we want to go into our CMS and we want to make sure for each of these, we have this marked. Let&#x27;s highlight this right here and make sure it&#x27;s an H2, which it is. We can check that on any of these to make sure each of them is an H2, which they are. Let&#x27;s escape back to this page. Back down here, there should also be an H2. It is, and that&#x27;s looking pretty good. We know at the bottom here, we have this contact form. We already know that&#x27;s an H2. We don&#x27;t have to scroll far for our last one because we want to name our input labels on our forms. So let&#x27;s go in, double click to edit our form block. We want to select each of these, the actual input fields, the text fields themselves. Click the cog, and make sure these have descriptive clear names.</p><p>This is where we can add descriptive value. In this case, it will be name not &quot;name 2.&quot; Email address, let&#x27;s double click this time email to, let&#x27;s say, &quot;Email address to be clear here.&quot; This one&#x27;s required, this one&#x27;s not. We could always make this one required. Double click this text area, custom message or message to Megan. We can make this not required. Since that&#x27;s our only form, that&#x27;s it for now. We&#x27;re off to a great start. We covered a lot of the alt text on our portfolio, we did color contrast, we identified empty links, we checked our headings and changed literally nothing, and we configured our form input labels. These are standard considerations. The more we all start thinking about... Gr√≠mur will talk about this in a moment. But the more we integrate this kind of design thinking into our entire process, the more our work will be accessible to both search engines and human beings, and that is a wonderful... Actually, excellent point.</p><p>[Sara] Thank you very much.</p><p>We&#x27;re going to include additional resources that you can find on Webflow University regarding accessible design and development. So check that out, if you haven&#x27;t already. In the meantime, Gr√≠mur...</p><p>[Gr√≠mur] Accessibility isn&#x27;t always an explicit goal. It&#x27;s a way of design thinking that we all need to do a better job of doing. So for the day&#x27;s challenge, share a webpage or a site you made more accessible, even if it&#x27;s not perfect yet. Part of us getting more accessible together means being okay with works in progress. We&#x27;re here to help each other out. Except for McGuire and Sara, who are, yes, leaving the studio once again, without me.</p><p>[door closes]</p><p><br/></p></div></nav></div></div><a href="/lesson/accessibility-audit" class="button cc-primary cc-margin-top w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a><div class="button-container"><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Download assets</div></a></div><div class="button-wrapper margin"><a href="https://webflow.com/website/Portfolio-course-Accessibility-audit" target="_blank" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block"><div>Clone this project</div></a></div><a href="#" class="button cc-primary w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a></div></div><div class="w-embed"><div style="display: none;" data-lesson-video-url="https://youtu.be/o2LqDsly1ks"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-2 lesson-content w-dyn-item"><div class="flex_vertical_left"><h2 class="h3 w-dyn-bind-empty"></h2><div class="rich_light w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="transcript-overflow w-condition-invisible"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></nav></div></div><a href="/lesson/launch" class="button cc-primary cc-margin-top w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a><div class="button-container"><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Download assets</div></a></div><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Clone this project</div></a></div><a href="#" class="button cc-primary w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a></div></div><div class="w-embed"><div style="display: none;" data-lesson-video-url=""></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-2 lesson-content w-dyn-item"><div class="flex_vertical_left"><h2 class="h3">Design review</h2><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>Sara Lundberg runs design for Webflow University, and today, she‚Äôll be walking through dozens of design notes on Megan‚Äôs portfolio site ‚Äî¬†from spacing to interactions (and everything in between).</p></div><div class="transcript-overflow"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>[McGuire] Here we are. The final design review and some more interactions before we cover the last steps in this course. We&#x27;ve made a ton of progress and it&#x27;s an absolute honor to introduce the person who runs design for all of Webflow University, Sara Lundberg.</p><p>[Sara] Now I get to teach. We&#x27;re going to review this whole portfolio together. We&#x27;ll cover spacing, link naming, paragraphs, we will add our resume and we will add more interactions.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] It sounded a little bit like you said, the word interactions, but you added several, several Zs at the end of interactions. Was that intentional?</p><p>[Sara] Did I? Did I do that?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Is that I got, is it Swedish?</p><p>[Sara] No, it&#x27;s not Swedish. Just, you know, when you teaching... Okay.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Okay. Should I continue freely?</p><p>[McGuire] Go ahead.</p><p>[Sara] Let&#x27;s start with spacing.</p><p>[McGuire] And homepage.¬†</p><p>[Sara] All right. So I have 23 notes.</p><p>[McGuire] On the homepage?</p><p>[Sara] Ye-, no. No, on the whole product.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. On spacing?</p><p>[Sara] On spacing.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] All right. What&#x27;s the first one?</p><p>[Sara] So go down to the product list and check that texture so we can make it even.</p><p>[McGuire] You&#x27;re talking between the H2, the Paragraph, and the collection list.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So the preference would be, let&#x27;s add some top margin here to even it out. How does 20 pixels look?¬†</p><p>[Sara] 20 looks good.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So now we have-</p><p>[Sara] No, no, no. I&#x27;m saying it. We have 22 left.</p><p>[McGuire] 22 left.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Perfect. So, you see on the product details, I want you to increase the padding on that card.</p><p>[McGuire] You&#x27;re saying on this card increase spending. So we have 30 on all sides. What are you... You&#x27;re looking at 60 or so?</p><p>[Sara] 60 would be perfect.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So 60, more spacing on the inside of each of the project details link blocks.</p><p>[Sara] So I want you to look at the text in that product detail, is, I want that to be even out. The spacing between each element.</p><p>[McGuire] Great catch. Okay. So, two options here. We can increase the space between architectural website and the project Paragraph preview, or we can decrease the space by kind of removing the... looks like I got 20 pixels of margin on the top of project name, preview. You have a preference there?</p><p>[Sara] Do you have 10? That would be great.</p><p>[McGuire] 10 on this one right here? Okay. So, vertical alignment between UX design, or the space between UX design, architectural website is more even.</p><p>[Sara] And scroll down to the contact form.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Contact form. Double-clicking, entering the symbol.</p><p>[Sara] Perfect. You remember we did the padding 60 on the product details?</p><p>[McGuire] Yes. Same thing on the-¬†</p><p>[Sara] I want them to be the same on the contact page.</p><p>[McGuire] Form block up to 60?</p><p>[Sara] Yes.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Great. So, it&#x27;s even. 60 pixels of padding, space inside on there. Now it&#x27;s evenly matched to the 60 pixels we changed in the project details.</p><p>[Sara] Awesome. So, just as you did the text even in the product details card, I want you to do it, the text even in the contact form.</p><p>[McGuire] So space between the H2, the dark Paragraph and this field label. Assuming we can just decrease the margin here to something like 20 or 15?</p><p>[Sara] 20 would be great.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] 20?</p><p>[Sara] That&#x27;s everything I have on the Desktop version on the homepage.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay, great. Good notes.¬†</p><p>[Sara] All right. So I have some notes on the Tablets. So, let&#x27;s go down to the Tablet breakpoint.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Tablet breakpoint. Here we are.</p><p>[Sara] So, the spacing is a little bit tight on this section. So can we add some more padding in there?</p><p>[McGuire] So on the section... So this is all sections, not just the top section?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So, we&#x27;ll add padding. In fact, we can option, click to remove. Do you want something like 60 or do you want a smaller number than that?</p><p>[Sara] 60 is perfect.</p><p>[McGuire] Great.¬†</p><p>[Sara] So, if you scroll down to the project details.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. The details-</p><p>[Sara] I want...</p><p>[McGuire] ... right here.</p><p>[Sara] Yes. I want you to increase the padding there.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Increase the padding there.</p><p>[Sara] Decrease!</p><p>[McGuire] You definitely said &quot;increase the padding.&quot; So, how much do you want to increase the padding to? Is 175 acceptable?¬†</p><p>[Sara] (laughing)</p><p>[McGuire] Did you want to increase? Did you want to increase the padding more?</p><p>[Sara] No. Decrease.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So 30?</p><p>[Sara] Perfect.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Great.¬†</p><p>[Sara] All right. So, scroll down to the contact form.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Contact form. We&#x27;re on Tablet.¬†</p><p>[Sara] So, I want you to decrease the padding there as well.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Back to 30 to match the top?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes. That&#x27;s great.</p><p>[McGuire] So, we have 30 padding here, 30 padding here, so we have that consistent line. That alignment right along here.</p><p>[Sara] So that&#x27;s it. Let&#x27;s go to Mobile landscape and look at the section padding there.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Section padding, we&#x27;ll select the section. Padding is currently 15.</p><p>[Sara] So I want you to increase that padding. I think 30 would be great.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] 30 is great. 30 on all sections.</p><p>[Sara] So if you look at the H1 here, it&#x27;s a little bit too large. Can you decrease that size?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Yes. 25, 22.¬†</p><p>[Sara] That looks good.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. H2 then, to decrease its size, to keep it proportionate?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] All right.¬†</p><p>[Sara] And the last thing, I want you to do the product details a little bit smaller padding on that one.</p><p>[McGuire] So, this is the project details, it&#x27;s 30. Something like 10 or 15?</p><p>[Sara] 15 would be great.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] All right, 15. With that, the assumption is you&#x27;re going to do the same thing with contact form to keep it even?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Exactly.</p><p>[McGuire] How many notes do we have left after this?</p><p>[Sara] So, we are on the 12th. So we have 11 more notes. Is that right?</p><p>[McGuire] That sounds like math.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yeah. All right. So that&#x27;s it on Mobile. Uh, let&#x27;s go to the larger breakpoints.</p><p>[McGuire] Larger breakpoint. 1920.¬†</p><p>[Sara] And I want you to look at the, uh, section padding here.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Section padding. Select your section. Currently 60, it&#x27;s being inherited from what we changed here to 60.</p><p>[Sara] Perfect. I want you to increase that padding.</p><p>[McGuire] Decrease it. Increase it?</p><p>[Sara] Nope. Increase. I think 100 would be great.</p><p>[McGuire] 100 top and bottom. That&#x27;ll affect all sections.</p><p>[Sara] That&#x27;s it for the homepage.</p><p>[McGuire] Going back to the base breakpoint. And the next page is?</p><p>[Sara] So, I don&#x27;t have anything on the contact page. So, let&#x27;s move on to the password and 404 page. Or what is the password-protected page? Can you show me that one?</p><p>[McGuire] So, you hadn&#x27;t provided a design, uh, design guidance on this one. So, we improvised.</p><p>[Sara] Oh. Cool. Minimal. I like the focus you have to the, to the Heading. Let&#x27;s move on to the password page and check out the larger breakpoint.</p><p>[McGuire] So password page, 1920.</p><p>[Sara] So yeah. The Heading, the whole thing, too wide.</p><p>[McGuire] So, we&#x27;ll select the password Heading here. Let&#x27;s decrease the size of that. We could do it on the typography here, or we could set a max width that&#x27;s closer to the original, and just decrease this... actually remove that size. So we&#x27;re matched to what&#x27;s going on here.</p><p>This was 30 at 1.1. This is 30 at 1.1. So it looks scaled down because we&#x27;re looking at the scaled view. Is the thought here you want to continue with this size? Or do you want to increase the size of the Heading on 1920?</p><p>[Sara] I mean it can be a little bit, uh, larger on the larger breakpoint.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So we&#x27;ll do Heading size of...</p><p>[Sara] I think 50 would be great.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] 50. So, in this case-</p><p>[Sara] I think 40, 45 would be great.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] 45. So, in this case, do you-¬†</p><p>[Sara] I think actually 40.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] We could, instead of having a max width of 280, we could say 320 or even-</p><p>[Sara] I feel like we don&#x27;t have to mess with that one.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] We can make it view port width characters.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Okay. That&#x27;s perfect.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. 20 VW.</p><p>[Sara] I mean, we could have done like 0.20.</p><p>[McGuire] Zero point 20.</p><p>[Sara] Okay. So, go back to 45. I think that was okay.</p><p>[McGuire] 45, VW?¬†</p><p>[Sara] No, pixels.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Pixels. Okay. 45 pixels on this breakpoint.</p><p>[Sara] So only nine left. Almost done. Let&#x27;s move on to the 404 page.</p><p>[McGuire] 404 page. Page 404.</p><p>[Sara] What will happen when the viewport gets smaller?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Still looks great.¬†</p><p>[Sara] It looks good. Smaller. Smaller. So you need to drag it to a smaller device. Can you see the issue here?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Contrast.</p><p>[Sara] Cutting&#x27;s too large. So, I want you to go to the Mobile and decrease the size-</p><p>[McGuire] So Mobile landscape, you wanna make the change?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yeah, I think that would be great.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay, so.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So, on the 404, on this text, uh, decrease it to 100 pixels?¬†</p><p>[Sara] That looks good.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So a hundred over here, even when it gets more narrow.</p><p>[Sara] That looks good for now. So, let&#x27;s move over to the product page and look at the buttons.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So, back to the base breakpoint. You&#x27;re talking about the buttons on the page, this button, right here?</p><p>[Sara] Yes. So, look at the space. So, let&#x27;s make sure there&#x27;s more space on the sides of the button.</p><p>[McGuire] So on the, on the left and right, something like 20 or 30?¬†</p><p>[Sara] That looks good.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So 20 on the left and right. 10 on the top and bottom.</p><p>[Sara] I also want you, since you are here, to decrease the margin from the text and the bottom.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Decrease?</p><p>[Sara] (laughs) Did I say it wrong again?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] No, it&#x27;s okay. If you want to decrease it, it&#x27;s... it&#x27;s certainly possible. How much did you want to decrease-</p><p>[McGuire] Just say when.¬†</p><p>[Sara] It&#x27;s flying. All right. So, increase the space between the text and the bottom.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Undo, undo, and increase the space on the project description underneath. So, 10 pixels, 20 pixels, 30 pixels. What are you feeling?¬†</p><p>[Sara] 30 would be great.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] 30 pixels.</p><p>[Sara] So, if you scroll down to the grids, I want them to be even gaps.</p><p>[McGuire] You&#x27;re saying the grid gaps here, which are 30, and the grid gaps here, which are probably 16. Yeah, 16.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes.</p><p>[McGuire] You want those even. Do you want to match this? So this is 16 and this is 16? Or do you wanna match the bottom to 30?¬†</p><p>[Sara] The bottom to 30.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] All right. So we&#x27;ll lock this and we&#x27;ll type 30. So now our grid gaps are matched between each of the three grids on the page. Again, this is 30 pixels here. This is 30 pixels here, on the columns and rows, and then also here in between each of the columns.</p><p>[Sara] So it&#x27;s going to be tighter on Tablet than Mobile, so, let&#x27;s make sure, uh, we decrease the gaps.</p><p>[McGuire] So, you&#x27;re saying the grid gaps on the image grid, something like... let&#x27;s lock that. 15 or 10?</p><p>[Sara] I think 10 would be great.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] So let&#x27;s do 10 pixels there. And then, assuming you want to match the same thing in other projects?</p><p>[Sara] Yes.</p><p>[McGuire] Get a grid, lock it, 10 pixels. Done.</p><p>[Sara] Cool. One thing to know, go down to Mobile, and I want the image grid to be one column.</p><p>[McGuire] So, the image grid. Image grid is currently a two by two. Remove that second column. Right-click, delete column.</p><p>[Sara] So, just make sure the gap matches.</p><p>[McGuire] Between other projects, and so this is presently 15 on this one. We can option, remove that so it inherits the 10. So, now we&#x27;re matching 10 pixels of spacing here, and 10 pixels with spacing here.</p><p>[Sara] Awesome. That&#x27;s it for Mobile. So let&#x27;s go to larger breakpoints and check the Heading.</p><p>[McGuire] 1920 Heading is a Heading.</p><p>[Sara] Okay. Um, Heading actually it looks great. The only thing that&#x27;s left is the Navbar.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Back to base breakpoint for the Navbar. Double click to edit our Symbol.</p><p>[Sara] Okay, so check out how responsive the menu is.</p><p>[McGuire] So, in Tablet, we initiate this menu button. We can go and open the menu.</p><p>[Sara] Look at the padding on the left there.</p><p>[McGuire] Great. So the nav link, we&#x27;ll go in there and increase the padding to 30 pixels on both sides so it&#x27;s matched.</p><p>[Sara] All right. Looks good. Check out Mobile portrait.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Mobile portrait. Assuming you&#x27;re looking at decreasing the padding to lineup the logo?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Exactly.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So we&#x27;ll decrease from 30 to about 10.</p><p>[Sara] We don&#x27;t have anything left. That&#x27;s it.</p><p>[McGuire] 23?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes.</p><p>[McGuire] All 23.¬†</p><p>[Sara] All 23. All right. So, that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s what we have for spacing. So let&#x27;s talk about naming. Can you go to the collection list on the homepage?</p><p>[McGuire] Going to the collection list on the homepage. Going back, going back here. Going to the collection list on the homepage, back to the base breakpoint. All right. We&#x27;re here, collection list.</p><p>[Sara] Right now, it&#x27;s not very accessible. If you use a screen reader, it will read UX design first.</p><p>[McGuire] That&#x27;s an excellent point. By default, screen readers are going to read the first text inside the link. However-</p><p>[Sara] You can use Flexbox.</p><p>[McGuire] Flexbox. So in project details, if we want this to be more specific, we can put together... using our collection, we can put together a more descriptive version of text. More descriptive text for someone using a screen reader who&#x27;s looking at more than just UX design.¬†</p><p>So, here&#x27;s how we can do that. For our button text here, we can continue to use this. But we&#x27;re going to wrap it with a Div block. Here&#x27;s why. If we go to command K, to enter quick find and add a Div block, we can use the Div block to organize a more descriptive title. So, we&#x27;re putting button text right in here and we can change this later. For right now, it&#x27;ll say, &quot;View project.&quot; But, we might want it to instead say, we&#x27;ll delete the word project, and so now it says &quot;view&quot;. And that&#x27;s okay for right now, because we&#x27;re going to add two more text elements.</p><p>So, inside this Div block we&#x27;re just going to copy and paste. And by default, text blocks take up full width. They&#x27;re block level elements. But we can set these to in-line block. So they&#x27;ll stack next to each other. Because on the second one, we want to bind it, we want to link this text, get this text, from the client name. Let&#x27;s close this out because right now it&#x27;ll show the name of it. It&#x27;s a little close right now. So we can always take &quot;view&quot; and we can just add a space. Just pressing shift-space to out of manual space after view.¬†</p><p>And the third button texts we want to use, let&#x27;s just copy and paste again. We&#x27;re going to unbind this and instead, again, shift-space project.</p><p>[Sara] Perfect.</p><p>[McGuire] And now that we have that Div block, we can place it right at the top. But we&#x27;re going to use some magic here.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Flexbox.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] That&#x27;s correct. Now, the first thing a screen reader is going to read is &quot;View. Dark horse plan. Project.&quot; Why have we done this? Why have we positioned a Div block at the top of this link block? Well, the reason is if we use a screen reader, it will now say-</p><p>[macOS VoiceOver] &quot;Link. View Darkhorse plan project, UX design, architectural website. I designed a layout inspired by architectural plans that responds to the user&#x27;s input and changes with each visit.&quot;</p><p>[McGuire] Now, the link is a lot more descriptive. And we can add a class to keep things organized. Let&#x27;s make this class project client preview. And here&#x27;s where Flexbox comes in. Because the document order is correct now, because screen readers will look to this first, we can aesthetically still move it to the end. We can change the Flexbox order to last. Now, this is at the bottom and we can add margin top, we can just set the top margin to auto. That&#x27;ll automatically create space. It&#x27;ll push project client preview to the bottom, inside the space available in our link block.</p><p>And if we expand the Navigator, over here to the left, we can see, we can always see that project client preview appears first. Usually screen readers will look to the official document order, the order inside the navigator, and it finds this first and will read &quot;View dark horse plan. Project.&quot;</p><p>[Sara] For Paragraphs, I only had one note here. Some are a little wide.</p><p>[McGuire] Agreed. And we can set maximum widths here at the Paragraphs level, at the all Paragraphs tag level. And a good example of this would be the contact page, the Paragraph does have a lot of texts we read from left to right. So let&#x27;s go in here.¬†</p><p>With any Paragraph selected, we can use the all Paragraphs tag. We can set a maximum width of something like 60 CH. And here&#x27;s how those work. One CH is equal to the width of the number zero in any font. So whatever font we&#x27;re using, if we set this max width to 60 CH on the all Paragraphs tag, it&#x27;ll never get wider than 60 zeros in that font. So, we&#x27;ve added it to all Paragraphs.¬†</p><p>There is one note, which is on the homepage. If we go back to the homepage, we set a maximum width. We manually set one on this class. So if we were to go back in, even though the assumption is this will affect all Paragraphs, we can see that though we&#x27;re inheriting two selectors... and we can go back to that all Paragraphs. We can see that the max width is crossed out. So if we click that we can see the value is overwritten by a more specific selector. And that&#x27;s of course, if we hit back, it&#x27;s the Paragraph itself. So all we have to do, let&#x27;s remove that more specific value. Let&#x27;s hit reset. And now it&#x27;s inheriting 60 CH. That 60 CH is controlled by all Paragraphs.</p><p>[Sara] All right. So that&#x27;s it for Paragraphs. But, a lot of portfolio site do have a resume and ours doesn&#x27;t. So I like to see if we can add one now.</p><p>[McGuire] Absolutely. And do you want this on...</p><p>[Sara] I want to make sure it&#x27;s on all pages, so let&#x27;s put it in the Navbar.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So Navbar, double click to edit. Assuming, do you want the nav link button or do you want it to look like the regular nav link?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Regular nav link.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So we&#x27;ll copy and paste. We&#x27;ll make this one Resume. We&#x27;ll make sure in element settings, it links people not to an external URL, but to a file, which we can upload. Now, Megan, our UX designer is entirely fictional, so she doesn&#x27;t have a resume. That&#x27;s okay. We can use the worksheets from P90X. Let&#x27;s go to our Assets panel and we can just drag the PDF from P90X, right into assets and that&#x27;s uploaded.¬†</p><p>And over here, instead of external URL, let&#x27;s have it linked to a file. And we&#x27;ll want to choose the asset and we&#x27;ll select P90X, workout sheets dot PDF. Again, with links like this, we can always choose to open it in the same tab, this tab, or we can open it in a new tab. In this case, we&#x27;ll open it in a new tab. And if we go to the preview and press Resume.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Awesome.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] That&#x27;s right, Sara. We have our P90X worksheets complete with military pushups, reverse grip chin-ups and heavy pants.</p><p>[Sara] Great design. So, notice the spacing between each of the nav links and the Say Hi button.</p><p>[McGuire] So you&#x27;re talking, the even space, you want even spacing in between... So, if we go to the Style panel here, we can see, we have 20 pixels of padding on the left and right here. Left and right here. But, because that padding is inside this color, you&#x27;re looking for probably 20 pixels on the left here?</p><p>[Sara] So it looks good here. But keep in mind, it&#x27;s going to affect different breakpoints.</p><p>[McGuire] So if we go to Tablet and we open up our Menu button, so let&#x27;s go here open Menu. We will see actually it looks like something there is red. Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s going on there. It looks like we do have the color red, let&#x27;s remove that. And let&#x27;s go to reset. And because we added that margin left of 20, we&#x27;re seeing that gap. Let&#x27;s make sure this is zero, which will even that out. And we&#x27;ll check here on Mobile landscape, Mobile portrait. Looks pretty even and matched here.</p><p>[Sara] Okay. So, that&#x27;s resume. Let&#x27;s do interactions.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] What was...</p><p>[Sara] Oh, I did do that.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Did you intend to extend the Z-</p><p>[Sara] Again?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Yes.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Oh, so there&#x27;s two notes I have. Let&#x27;s start with a Lottie interaction on the contact form.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Contact form. We&#x27;ll go back to the base breakpoint and go down to the contact. In fact, let&#x27;s do this in the contact page so everything&#x27;s neat and organized. And here we are in the form block.</p><p>[Sara] So I want to add this to our success message.</p><p>[McGuire] So, we&#x27;ll go over to element settings and go to Success. So normally it will say, &quot;Thank you. Your submission has been received.&quot; You want to add a lot of animation here?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Yes.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Where do you want to go for a lot of animation?</p><p>[Sara] If you go into Lottiefiles.com.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Lottiefiles.com.</p><p>[Sara] And you can see on the search bar there, search for the Lottie animation you want. So for example, success.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Confetti.</p><p>[Sara] Let&#x27;s do success.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Success.</p><p>[Sara] All right so, there is a bunch in her. Let&#x27;s scroll and see which one we like. The one on the bottom left there, it looks great.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] So we&#x27;ll click this. Let&#x27;s download the Lottie Jason.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Great. So let&#x27;s get it into Webflow.</p><p>[McGuire] So back to Webflow, we&#x27;ll drag our Lottie Jason file from off the screen, then we&#x27;ll just drop it right in success message.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Perfect.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] And it&#x27;s default duration looks like three seconds, if we preview the animation, we can see it&#x27;s quite large. So, a couple things here. First off, on the success message itself. Do you want it to still have this grey color or do you want a transparent background?¬†</p><p>[Sara] Transparent.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. Let&#x27;s do transparent. And then let&#x27;s set a limiter on this. So a Lottie animation, let&#x27;s set a maximum width of 300 pixels. We can set the margin on both sides to auto so that it centers.</p><p>[Sara] Can you put it above the text?¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Yes. Above the text and let&#x27;s go to preview so we can see what this looks like.</p><p>[Sara] Can you make the size a little bit smaller?</p><p>[McGuire] So you want to increase the maximum width to a larger number?¬†</p><p>[Sara] No, smaller.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. So, 100.¬†</p><p>[Sara] That looks good.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] So here it is.¬†</p><p>[Sara] Only thing I would note is add some spacing on the top and bottom of that Lottie animation.</p><p>[McGuire] So on the top, we already seem to have 20 pixels of padding. So, do you want to add 20 pixels underneath in margin?</p><p>[Sara] Looks good.</p><p>[McGuire] 20 and preview.</p><p>[Sara] Okay. So, that looks good. So, the other thing I wanted to do is to match the interaction on the product page to the homepage.</p><p>[McGuire] So, you&#x27;re saying over in the projects template.</p><p>[Sara] If you scroll down, let&#x27;s do the same glow interaction we did on the homepage.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] Okay. We can do that. So let&#x27;s duplicate our project image. Let&#x27;s go to duplicate, just like we did in the homepage. We can remove the class from this and use... it was something that ended in effect. There it is. Selected projects effect. And a couple changes we have to make.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] The first one we want to do is we want to set this to fill the space available inside this pa. So we want to position it around its parent we&#x27;ll select full. And the second thing we need to do, because it&#x27;s absolutely positioned, we need to make sure its parent, the link block is set to relative positioning. Now, whenever we&#x27;re styling a class that&#x27;s used on multiple pages, we always want to go back and verify that it&#x27;s still working as expected on the other page. So let&#x27;s go back to home. We&#x27;ll scroll down, go into preview mode and we&#x27;ll hover over to make sure our glow effect is functioning properly.</p><p>[McGuire] And it seems to be functioning properly. So with that in mind, let&#x27;s go back to our projects template because while we have the element there, the interaction hasn&#x27;t yet been applied. So we want to apply the interaction when someone hovers into the link block. So we can go over to interactions and this&#x27;ll be a lot quicker because we&#x27;ve built the interaction before let&#x27;s go in and add an element trigger. We want this happening when the mouse hovers over the element. So we&#x27;ll choose mouse hover on hover. We want to start in animation, but we&#x27;ve already created this. We&#x27;ve created selected projects, hover, and I&#x27;ll have her out. We&#x27;ve just select an existing animation selected projects out. And just like that, we can go to preview mode and see that as we hover over, we see the glow effect come in. And as we hover out, it goes away. Hover in, hover out.</p><p>[Sara] Okay. So I have this idea. I would talk about it later then anyway, nicely done. So it&#x27;s really important that we keep on iterating. Keep on designing in this review. We&#x27;ll look at spacing. We used flex folks on the collection list to make the link more accessible. We used character units to limit how wide Paragraphs are we added a resume for Megan about pushups, heavy pans and chins. We added some interactions and then you got to listen to me recap everything. Grimur?¬†</p><p>[Grimur] How about YOUR design? We‚Äôve seen some incredible posts on #21dayportfolio, but I also want to do a design review on Berkshire Hathaway at some point. Half a trillion market cap, but they‚Äôre still rocking Times New Roman. Share YOUR redesign (whether it‚Äôs for your portfolio, or even if you redesign ANOTHER company‚Äôs site) ‚Äî I want to see it. Oh my God.

And this lesson will be pretty quick: we‚Äôll do publishing to our webflow.io domain, and then we‚Äôll show how to connect a custom domain (whateveryoursiteis.com or .net or .biz. .info‚Äî .is? Grimur?).</p><p>[Grimur] Yeah, that&#x27;s Iceland.</p><p>Let‚Äôs start with the first one. All we need to do to publish Megan‚Äôs portfolio? Let‚Äôs check in Project Settings to look at two parts here: (1) is the subdomain what we WANT it to be? This is where we could change it, but let‚Äôs leave it and look at our SECOND thing: (2) we‚Äôll go over to SEO...and we‚Äôll make sure that THAT subdomain is currently getting indexed by search engines (that‚Äôs USUALLY what we want). If we want to set up a rule so search engines are told NOT to look at our site, we can do that, too, but for us, we‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs indexed by search. Let&#x27;s save those changes.</p><p>And we COULD publish here, but most commonly, we‚Äôll publish from the Designer. In either case, we just want to make sure it‚Äôs selected? And we‚Äôll hit one button: Publish.</p><p>That‚Äôs part 1. Now if you want to connect a custom domain, it‚Äôs just a few more steps, and once we set those up? Publishing is still literally ONE click. And we can do this part in Project Settings as well, under the Hosting tab. Now, you‚Äôll want to make sure to add a site plan first, and once you‚Äôve done that, down on the page you‚Äôll see we can add a custom domain.</p><p>All we have to do? Is type in that custom domain. Now. Our fictional UX designer named Megan has a custom domain: garciaux.com. We got this domain from Google Domains. And we‚Äôll follow THAT process. And while the setup we‚Äôre doing is similar for MOST places you‚Äôd have your domain, we‚Äôve added a link to our FULL article which has each and every step written out to follow along.</p><p>But the idea...is to ADD our domain. Now, this part‚Äôs important: we usually don‚Äôt want our subdomain (the webflow.io domain) AND our custom domain BOTH getting indexed by Google and other search engines, so by default, it‚Äôs turning OFF indexing on the webflow.io subdomain ‚Äî and it‚Äôs doing this since we‚Äôre adding our CUSTOM domain (that‚Äôs the one we want showing up in search). Long story short, 99% of the time, we‚Äôre just going to press...OK.</p><p>And a lot of stuff comes up for directions, but we only have to do three things. And we‚Äôre following the WWW version (Option 1).</p><p>Over on Google Domains (this is where we bought garciaux.com), let&#x27;s go to &quot;My domains&quot; where we&#x27;ll find all the domains we&#x27;ve purchased. And we want to select garciaux.com, since that&#x27;s the domain we&#x27;ll be connecting our portfolio to. And we‚Äôre looking for our DNS records (our DNS settings). A quick note before you change records like this ‚Äî we recommend always taking a screenshot or writing down (backing up your records here in case you want to change them back later).</p><p>But all we have to do is add two A records. And, what we‚Äôve done ahead of time, is we‚Äôve cleared out our resource records. (You may have, in yours, a ton of resource records, and that‚Äôs okay.) But we can only have two resource records that are A records, that point to a host, that point to a name of @. If you have OTHER A records pointing elsewhere, that‚Äôs okay, but you can only have two that are A records that point to a name of @. Let‚Äôs do the first one.</p><p>Back in Webflow? We‚Äôre going to click to grab this first IP address (we‚Äôll click it), that‚Äôs going to copy it to our clipboard. (Now, from time to time, Webflow might UPDATE these IP addresses, so yours might not match this video perfectly; that‚Äôs okay ‚Äî we‚Äôre just clicking whatever the FIRST value is here.)¬†</p><p>Back to Google, we‚Äôll paste. That‚Äôs the first one, and the second one, we‚Äôll press to add ANOTHER record. And of course, back in Webflow, click to copy the second IP address, that second value, back over to Google, and paste.¬†</p><p>We have both of them (two A records) that point to a name of @. And let‚Äôs click to make sure we ADD. (That‚Äôs the first and second part of this ‚Äî only one part left.)</p><p>Let‚Äôs go back and grab our CNAME record. This is the CNAME record, the name of www, and it points to THIS domain, let‚Äôs copy that. We‚Äôll go and add CNAME, points to www, and we‚Äôll make sure we add that specific URL.</p><p>This is what we have on our screen; yours could look different, especially if you‚Äôre using a different registrar (if you‚Äôre using something other than Google Domains). We recommend taking a look at that full article before making any changes, and always back up these resource records. Take a screenshot, write them down, whatever you need to do, before you modify any DNS records. Let‚Äôs go back over to our hosting tab, and we‚Äôll press check status. Check status.</p><p>Now, it might say there are issues detected. That‚Äôs okay. Sometimes this can take a few moments before it goes through. We can press again, and now it says connected. (Yours could take longer, sometimes this stuff does ‚Äî we‚Äôre here to help, so check the article for some specifics here, and reach out to our team if we can help in any way.)</p><p>But let‚Äôs wrap up by choosing our default. We‚Äôll choose the WWW version as the default here.¬†</p><p>So what does all this do? Well, now we can go back to the Designer. (Again, we can do this from the Dashboard, but we‚Äôll go back to the Designer.) We can take a look at our site. When we go down to Publish, it‚Äôs still on the staging domain, but we can make sure we‚Äôre PUBLISHING to our custom domain. Publish? That‚Äôs it. No FTP stuff needed, no reconciling file versions. Just publish.</p><p>But that‚Äôs it! We covered publishing a portfolio to the subdomain, and we covered connecting to a CUSTOM domain. Up next, we‚Äôll get everything up and running with Google including Google Analytics. Grimur?</p><p>[Grimur] I just published my site. And now I‚Äôm going to do it again. Click. Click. Click. Actually, my MacBook Pro is completely out of battery, and it‚Äôs actually been that way for several days now. But once you‚Äôve published YOUR site, share it on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Revvit. And remember to use the #21dayportfolio so we can pick out our favorites so we can showcase them. Oh, look. A charger.<br/></p></div></nav></div></div><a href="/lesson/publish-and-launch" class="button cc-primary cc-margin-top w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a><div class="button-container"><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Download assets</div></a></div><div class="button-wrapper margin"><a href="https://webflow.com/website/Megan-Garcia-Portfolio" target="_blank" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block"><div>Clone this project</div></a></div><a href="#" class="button cc-primary w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a></div></div><div class="w-embed"><div style="display: none;" data-lesson-video-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7OeEn_pxm84"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="collection-item-2 lesson-content w-dyn-item"><div class="flex_vertical_left"><h2 class="h3">Verify your site and track analytics</h2><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>Now that you&#x27;ve built your entire portfolio, it&#x27;s time to own it by verifying your site. Get ownership of your site and understand how visitors interact with your portfolio site to optimize performance and search engine settings.</p></div><div class="transcript-overflow"><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="w-dropdown"><div class="button cc-grey w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div><div class="cc-button-icon-right">Transcript</div></div><nav class="transcript-dropdown w-dropdown-list"><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>Everybody knows there are three big steps when launching a portfolio for the world to see. And in this lesson, we&#x27;ll cover two of them, Google Site Verification, so we can control indexing, confirm ownership and Google Analytics. Now, this is the pen penultimate lesson in our course that walks through building and launching a portfolio site from the future. And there are a lot of things we made sure we did first before this lesson, like building and launching a portfolio site from the future. Let&#x27;s pick up there with verifying our portfolio on Google. This is not Google. Now we&#x27;re in our project, let&#x27;s go over to our project settings.</p><p>From here, let&#x27;s go to the SEO tab. And what we&#x27;re looking for is Google Site Verification, right here. So let&#x27;s click to visit Google Search Console. Now, this could look a little different depending on if you have existing sites you&#x27;ve verified in Google or maybe not. But what we&#x27;re looking for, is the ability to add a new property, so we&#x27;ll go to add property. For this example, we&#x27;re going to use the www variant, so let&#x27;s go https://www.garciaux.com. And once we&#x27;ve typed out our URL, let&#x27;s go to continue.</p><p>You might not see this dialog box, yours could auto verify depending on where your domain was purchased and where it lives. But for a lot of people, this is what they&#x27;ll see. Now, one of the quickest ways to do this is to go into the HTML tag option. Then all we&#x27;re looking to grab is this snippet right here, where it says content. So we can double click and copy our content to our clipboard that way or if it&#x27;s difficult to select, we can copy the entire string and just paste it into a text editor. So we can grab everything between the two quotes after content. So with that copy to our clipboard, back to Webflow, we&#x27;re going to paste our site verification ID. Save changes, and of course, we want to publish our site for changes to take effect.</p><p>Let&#x27;s go up, publish, and we want to make sure we publish to our custom domain we just added to Google and we&#x27;ll press publish. And once we&#x27;ve published, let&#x27;s go back to Google. In our HTML tag option, let&#x27;s scroll down and make sure we can press verify. Checking verification, ownership verified. And now that we verified, let&#x27;s quickly go to our property so we can talk about indexing. And of course, once we&#x27;re there, we can check, it&#x27;s processing data, please check again in a day or so, but what we really want to do is go up here to inspect any URL, so let&#x27;s press this and let&#x27;s go straight for the homepage https://www.garciaux.com. Press return. Pretend for a moment that Stacy isn&#x27;t just out of frame on Zoom, laughing at that bad example of typing. And of course, we&#x27;re here. URL inspection.</p><p>Now immediately, the URL won&#x27;t appear on Google. We can always manually request indexing when our page has changed, so we can press that here and it&#x27;s going to test if this live published URL can be indexed. And when that&#x27;s done, the URL has been added to a priority crawl queue. Let&#x27;s press got it. Then we can always stop there or we can test the live URL. This is great for validation for checking to make sure things can be indexed and one great example here is if we hit view tested page, we can take a look at the HTML that&#x27;s crawled by Google, we can take a look at a screenshot of what&#x27;s captured and more info. In this case, if we look in page resources, we&#x27;ll see, there is one image, part of the reCAPTCHA validation that doesn&#x27;t show up, that image does not, nor should it show up in search results.</p><p>One of the reasons we want to validate like this is so we can test our site, so we can find out is Google able to accurately crawl everything on our site that we want it to crawl? And in this case, it&#x27;s working okay. So, with that being said, let&#x27;s move on from Google Site Verification to Google Analytics. Back to Webflow, let&#x27;s go over to integrations. Here&#x27;s where we&#x27;ll enter our Google Analytics info, so let&#x27;s go to Google Analytics. And once we&#x27;re here, we want to create a new property. We&#x27;ll make sure we&#x27;re logged in. We can click this cog icon here and your account may look different, but what you&#x27;re looking for is to create a new property, so we&#x27;ll create a new property.</p><p>Let&#x27;s name our property, we&#x27;ll call it Megan Garcia, UX Designer Portfolio. We&#x27;ll keep this the way it is. You can always look at advanced options, but for right now, we&#x27;re going to press next. Business information. Industry category. Fictional is not an option, so we&#x27;ll choose Books and Literature. Business size, small, and we intend to use Google Analytics for a few different things. Create. Then once we&#x27;re there, let&#x27;s press web www.garciaux.com. For stream name, let&#x27;s just use Megan Garcia Portfolio and we&#x27;ll press create stream. And this is our measurement ID. This is what we want to copy to our clipboard.</p><p>Of course, back in Webflow, we&#x27;ll paste that ID right here in the Universal Analytics Tracking ID and make sure that our global site tag is turned to yes, is flipped to yes. Let&#x27;s save changes. And of course, publish to take effect, let&#x27;s publish and publish. Back to Google Analytics, we can go out, let&#x27;s go up to home. And this is where we can see our completely fictional UX designer, Megan Garcia has absolutely no activity on her site, until, let&#x27;s view real time, and that&#x27;s Gr√≠mur from his mobile phone.</p><p>So we did two big things here, we claimed ownership of our portfolio on Google and we configured Google Analytics. Up next, we&#x27;ll cover a critical step in maintaining our portfolio, but first Gr√≠mur is going to come dangerously close to breaking his contract with Webflow by disclosing key internals and we&#x27;re going to do absolutely nothing to stop him. Gr√≠mur?</p><p>[Gr√≠mur] I&#x27;m on Google Analytics for Webflow&#x27;s internals right now, and in my contract, I&#x27;m forbidden from sharing these details with you. Let me just say, Webflow is getting very popular, especially among Gr√≠mur fans. There are tens of thousands of reasons you should be a Gr√≠mur fan, but something&#x27;s different for this lesson, because it was setting up Google Analytics and verification and whatever. What can you see on social? Here&#x27;s what I want to see. I want to see a full page shot of any of the pages of your portfolio, homepage, contact, whatever. And there are some great browser extensions that do this really well.</p><p>Anyway, I&#x27;m seeing if I can tie in Google Analytics with my data generator to create Pym particles, but I&#x27;m told I can&#x27;t, mainly because of science, but also because they&#x27;re fictional.

But some of the most important stuff we need to cover is in this lesson. We‚Äôve covered the skills we‚Äôve covered the build...now what should we be doing with all of it?¬†</p><p>Let‚Äôs get into that by starting with what we‚Äôve done so far (so we can cover what we need to do). We‚Äôve built out an entire homepage that‚Äôs tailored to respond to our user story. (As a business owner or hiring manager, I want to explore and validate the quality of this portfolio, so I can hire this entirely fictional person as a UX designer.) Then we used the CMS to organize projects that help Megan‚Äôs potential clients or employers validate her work by building out Collection pages (unique pages with designs that reference all that data...)</p><p>[Sara] Those data.</p><p>[McGuire] Those data. We built a contact page (which people can click over to from any page). We did our SEO and Open Graph settings to optimize for search, we redesigned our entire site which is now a light version. We created 2D and 3D interactions with various animations built on triggers like scrolling. We created a custom 404 page for when a page isn‚Äôt found, a custom password page so Megan can share stuff with her fictional clients behind password protection, we did an accessibility audit to improve the site experience for humans and search engines, we did a design review to ensure consistency and legibility, we published our site on a custom domain: garciaux.com. We set up Google for verification and indexing and analytics. We covered adding a new project or new client to Megan‚Äôs portfolio. And then we recapped almost everything we did, leading to this very sentence.</p><p>[Sara] What did we learn?</p><p>[McGuire] Follow the design.</p><p>[Sara] Yeah, okay, but, no, that‚Äôs not what I mean.</p><p>[McGuire] What do you mean‚Äî</p><p>[Sara] Do you realize what happens when you film without me here?</p><p>[McGuire] What happens‚Äî</p><p>[Sara] You confused the word ‚Äúmy.‚Äù &quot;Working with Megan Garcia...&quot;</p><p>[McGuire] We have a lesson...</p><p>[Sara] &quot;Working with Megan Garcia...&quot;</p><p>[McGuire] (whispering) Can we do this later?</p><p>[Sara] &quot;Working with Megan Garcia absolutely changed BY business.&quot;</p><p>[McGuire] &quot;My business.&quot;</p><p>[Sara] Exactly.</p><p>[McGuire] Okay, we can fix that real quick.</p><p>[Sara] I already went in and fixed it. Why is the lamp shaking?</p><p>[McGuire] But our work‚Äôs not done yet. An effective portfolio is a living, breathing, constantly evolving thing ‚Äî and we want to revisit it. And what we want to cover here as it relates to maintaining and growing our portfolios over time is focus.</p><p>And a common question we get all the time, especially for those who don‚Äôt have the types of clients (or types of projects) they want in their portfolio, is this: how do we get the types of clients (or types of projects) we want in our portfolio? Well, it goes like this:</p><p>By default, our instinct in many cases can be to add everything we‚Äôve done (or at least everything we‚Äôve done recently). But a lot of times, that means our portfolios are filled with the kind of work we‚Äôve happened to do; not the kind of work we‚Äôre wanting to do (the stuff that inspires us or motivates us or introduces a new chapter ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs getting clients, looking for a new job, getting industry recognition ‚Äî whatever it is).</p><p>And what a lot of us learn here is that if we only feature the kind of work we‚Äôve happened to do...and it doesn‚Äôt align well with what we want to do? We can get typecast in a role that gets us caught up in a cycle. So. To break that cycle, one extremely effective way to enhance a design portfolio is to do a redesign. Redesign or update or improve a design in a way that your work on that inspires you. Want to redesign apple.com? Great, you have the tools, you have the skills, and you have the ability to make it happen. App redesign, interface design ‚Äî in our portfolio, we want to show ‚Äî we want to highlight where we‚Äôre going. Write the next chapter, make the next move, focus on what‚Äôs important for you, and we‚Äôre here to support you each and every step of the way.</p><p>And for those getting into freelance and agency work (or if you‚Äôre looking to significantly grow your business in those areas), we created The Freelancer‚Äôs Journey. And this IS and always will be free on Webflow University. And it covers everything from getting clients (including pricing your work, client proposals ‚Äî so much of what we‚Äôve learned over the years in growing our businesses) And it goes all the way through the journey of this kind of work: an entire unit on content strategy, another on the principles of design, and going through the entire site build and launch for a completely different entirely fictional client... from the perspective of a freelancer. So. Check that out on Webflow University if you haven‚Äôt already.</p><p>But that‚Äôs the big idea: iterate, yes, but focus. Not just on the portfolio (that can sometimes be another trap ‚Äî spending SO much time tweaking the portfolio design itself that we don&#x27;t focus enough on the work we feature). Make a checklist of the essentials to focus on for you type of work. Sara‚Äôs done this since yesterday.</p><p>[Sara] You didn‚Äôt make the testimonials responsive.</p><p>[McGuire] Great catch. Fixing that right now.</p><p>[Sara] While you&#x27;re at it, you also forgot to set the alt text on Megan‚Äôs logo. Why is this lamp shaking again?</p><p>[McGuire] See, that felt actually like you were making a threat. [Sara] A threat again?</p><p>[McGuire] No.</p><p>[Sara] I would not make a threat again.</p><p>[McGuire] You know that was like four meters from the desk?</p><p>[Sara] Oh, I thought you did foots. Feets. Meters in Swedish.</p><p>[McGuire] How does 20 look? 19? 18?</p><p>[Sara] 20 looks great.</p><p>[McGuire] 20.</p><p>[Sara] The contract‚Äî Contract...</p><p>[McGuire] What&#x27;s wrong with your contract?</p><p>[Sara] The contrast ratios...</p><p>[McGuire] ...Yes?</p><p>[Sara] They‚Äôre a lot better.</p><p>[McGuire] Good, and we can get better over time. Remember, when it comes to ocus is just as much about saying no to non-pressing things so we can put our full attention on what matters. And in a portfolio, that‚Äôs usually the work. Whether it‚Äôs a redesign, client work, work for a past employer, or even an entirely fictional company (which, it might be a good idea to say something about that so people don‚Äôt Google this fictional company and find nothing at all...which would be...)</p><p>[Sara] Hilarious...no, just kidding.</p><p>[McGuire] Actually, it would be...hilarious. But our goal in this work (fictional or not), of course, is to convey trust and authority: two major components of client and employer decision-making that by the way, are just as critical for search engines.</p><p>So. With that in mind, only two things left to do: (1) Grimur‚Äôs going to walk us through adding our completed portfolio to the Webflow Showcase for increased visibility. And (2) we have travel back in time to the beginning of 2021 so we can release this course from the future, in the past...</p><p>[Grimur] Mmmm...no, it&#x27;s the present. Yeah, just gotta think about it.</p><p>[McGuire] From our perspective...</p><p>[Grimur] So, this has gotten you in hot water before. This isn‚Äôt Back to the Future, it‚Äôs actual time travel.</p><p>[McGuire] The course will travel to the past without changing the past.</p><p>[Grimur] McGuire, you‚Äôre awfully cavalier about such an important topic. But let‚Äôs do the Showcase: How do we do it? Let me show you.</p><p>Actually, my laptop is still dead. And I haven‚Äôt plugged in my Apple-branded 96-watt adapter. But if my computer was on, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd see, and maybe Stacy can help me out here by putting a screen recording of this over my face.</p><p>In our project, go to Project settings. And if we go down, we have our options for the Showcase. We have the flip the switch on, BUT, if your profile isn‚Äôt public on Webflow, you gotta do that first.</p><p>We can always click over to make our profile public. And from there, you can fill out your profile info ‚Äî ours, of course, is showing the information for Megan (who, again, not real ‚Äî she‚Äôs not a real person). Yours can be for you or your business.</p><p>Now. We want to make sure to flip the switch to make our profile public. Let‚Äôs save. And if we go back to our Project settings and refresh? Now we have the option to showcase this portfolio.</p><p>And once we go through that, all we have to do is put in relevant information about this site. But before we do that, let&#x27;s publish our subdomain. Now we can type in our relevant information. Type type type, I really wish my MacBook Pro had battery.</p><p>Of course, we have the option to let others clone our project (maybe you want to show them how you made your portfolio) ‚Äî that‚Äôs always an option, too.</p><p>And if I‚Äôm finished? Let&#x27;s...showcase our site. And now it&#x27;s showcased.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm exhausted after using my mind like that. But I feel good about this site, which is for an entirely fictional designer, you know, going out to the world.</p><p>[McGuire] Thank you, Grimur. For our last step, we‚Äôre going to end our 2021...by starting...2021. From the future. In the present.</p><p>[Sara] Okay, that didn&#x27;t make any sense.¬†</p><p>[McGuire] No, it did not. Except in the ways that it did.</p><p>[Sara] Okay. Good news, when I snap my fingers, we&#x27;re done with this course.</p><p>[McGuire] Sounds good.</p><p>[Grimur] Yeah I&#x27;m ready. Let&#x27;s‚Äî Okay, let&#x27;s go.</p><p>[McGuire] Are you ever going to‚Äî<br/></p></div></nav></div></div><a href="/lesson/final-thoughts-portfolio-showcase" class="button cc-primary cc-margin-top w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a><div class="button-container"><div class="button-wrapper margin w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Download assets</div></a></div><div class="button-wrapper margin"><a href="https://webflow.com/website/Megan-Garcia-Portfolio" target="_blank" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block"><div>Clone this project</div></a></div><a href="#" class="button cc-primary w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Read the full article</div></a></div></div><div class="w-embed"><div style="display: none;" data-lesson-video-url="https://youtu.be/6FMtTCJB62E"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="u-c-card"><div><h3 class="h6">Requirements</h3><div class="rich_light w-richtext"><p>Our goal is simple: we want to empower designers and agencies from all disciplines (UX, brand, product, graphic, fashion, industrial, and short track speed skating) to build a CMS-driven portfolio in 21 days that will generate leads ‚Äî and potentially tear a hole in the very fabric of space and time.</p><p>We included everything we learned about content strategy, information architecture, and quantum mechanics to create a course unlike any other course in the past, present, or future. </p><p><br/></p></div><div class="button-wrapper"><a href="https://webflow.com/team/Webflow-University" target="_blank" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block"><div>Clone this project</div></a><div class="paragraph_12 last">Use this version to clone the completed project</div></div><div class="button-wrapper w-condition-invisible"><a href="#" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block w-condition-invisible"><div>Clone this project</div></a><div class="paragraph_12 last">Blank pages without hitting page limits</div></div><div class="button-wrapper"><a href="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/edu/assets/Portfolio_course_assets.f40f57ba8a.zip" target="_blank" class="button cc-grey w-inline-block"><div>Download course assets</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 2" class="w-tab-pane"><div class="overview-content"><div class="overview-description l-center"><div class="html-embed-8 w-embed w-script"><div id="disqus_thread"></div>
